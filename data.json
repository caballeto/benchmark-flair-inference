Tiger couldn\u2019t help but be impressed, calling it an \u201cawesome shot.\u201d\n\nCharlie, 11, finished off the hole on the next shot, giving the Woods\u2019 an eagle. The shot pushed the team to -3 through 3 holes.\n\n\"I've seen this,\" Tiger said of the eagle, via ESPN.\n\n\"A lot of the shots he's hit. I've seen it this entire year, this entire pandemic. He hit these shots. The few events he's played in, he's hit a lot of these shots.\n\n\u201cBut this is a totally different deal.\"\n\nIt wasn\u2019t Charlie\u2019s only highlight of the day. Turns out, Tiger\u2019s son has plenty of skills on a golf course.\n\nCharlie and Tiger kept up that success Saturday, finishing -10 on the day. That tied them for sixth. Matt Kuchar and his 12-year-old son Cameron lead the way at the event with a -14.\n\n\u201c[Charlie] hit some of the most incredible golf shots,\u201d Tiger said, via ESPN. \u201cHe had the best time. It couldn't have been a better environment.\"\n\nThe PNC Championship began Saturday, and will run through Sunday. The event features 20 teams of two players. The winners will take home a $200,000 prize.\n\nTeam Woods played well Saturday, but will need to step up their game to take home the top prize Sunday.\n\nThe PNC Championship has been a true family affair for Tiger and Charlie, because their caddies were also a father-son duo.\n\nTiger\u2019s caddie, Joe LaCava, is brought his son, Joe Jr., to caddy for Charlie.\n\nLaCava was extremely excited to be participating in the event with his son and both Woods boys, especially since he didn\u2019t think it would happen this soon. According to him, Charlie\u2019s interest in golf is fairly recent.\n\n\u201cAbout a month ago Tiger approached me and said, \u2018I\u2019m thinking of playing the PNC Championship with Charlie.\u2019 I was so jacked up. I was like, \u2018Are you kidding me?\u2019 because I thought it was probably a year or two away,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHe was so excited. Charlie caught the golf bug this year. He\u2019s been playing a ton of golf, practicing, working at it, and was psyched to play.\n\n\u201cTiger was kind enough to ask me to ask Joe to caddie for Charlie so we could have a father-son caddie duo and father-son player duo. So, we\u2019re going to have a good weekend.\u201d\n\nIf Charlie already looks that much like his dad after less than a year of training, the golf world may want to brace itself. Charlie could be even more dangerous than his dad.\n\nClick here to sign up to our newsletter for all the latest and breaking stories from Australia and around the world.", "topic": "sports", "tag": "headline", "types": [], "claim": "", "verdict": ""}, {"url": "https://wwos.nine.com.au/cricket/mohammed-shami-reportedly-ruled-out-of-australia-tour-broken-arm-india/3e1aec2b-54cb-43fa-98f5-95d16ad2c2fe", "source": "wwos.nine.com.au", "authors": ["Chris De Silva"], "title": "Mohammed Shami reportedly set to miss remainder of Test series with fractured arm - Wide World of Sports", "pubDate": "2020-12-19T21:00:05+00:00", "description": "Mohammed Shami is set to miss the remainder of the Test series with a fractured arm, according to reports", "imageUrl": "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/4XC9mOgzT_QgNZk8eS38W9isX7k=/0x0/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2Ffs%2Fa1274532-f619-4172-8890-e0da5b03c456", "language": "en", "country": "au", "content": "Indian seamer Mohammed Shami could miss the remainder of the Australia tour after reports in India suggested that scans revealed that he fractured his arm.\n\nShami copped a nasty hit on his right forearm after attempting to dodge a short delivery from Pat Cummins in India's calamitous second innings in the first Test.\n\nHe attempted to bat on but struggled to grip the bat and retired hurt before failing to take the field during Australia's second innings.\n\nAccording to the Press Trust of India (PTI), scans have revealed that Shami has a fracture in his right arm.\n\n\"Mohammed Shami has a fracture and the chances of him taking part in the remaining three Test matches is next to nil,\" the report read.\n\nUncapped paceman Mohammed Siraj is said to be the leading candidate to replace Shami for the Boxing Day Test, while Navdeep Saini is the other pace option in the Test squad.\n\nThe decision on Shami's replacement is one of a number of selection headaches for Indian coach Ravi Shastri heading into the second Test.\n\nKL Rahul is expected to replace outgoing skipper Virat Kohli in the line-up, while young keeper Rishabh Pant and uncapped opener Shubman Gill could also be inclusions.\n\nFor a daily dose of the best of the breaking news and exclusive content from Wide World of Sports, subscribe to our newsletter by clicking here!", "topic": "sports", "tag": "headline", "types": [], "claim": "", "verdict": ""}, {"url": "https://www.foxsports.com.au/nfl/nfl-2020-playoff-picture-analysis-drew-brees-return-saints-vs-chiefs-nfc-afc-playoff-race-seeds-wildcards-news/news-story/43a19241a355b057b689165d97176f36?nk=d75b49a92e01696c7d7bf2156aa877a3-1608487019", "source": "foxsports.com.au", "authors": ["Max Laughton with AFP"], "title": "NFL playoff picture: Super Bowl preview gets even bigger \u2014 see where your team sits - Fox Sports", "pubDate": "2020-12-19T07:17:00+00:00", "description": "Drew Brees will start at quarterback for the New Orleans Saints in their clash with the Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs, Saints coach Sean Payton confirmed on Saturday (AEDT).", "imageUrl": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/21e5a4f398e4a237810f4481068289ca", "language": "en", "country": "au", "content": "Drew Brees will start at quarterback for the New Orleans Saints in their clash with the Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs, Saints coach Sean Payton confirmed on Saturday (AEDT).\n\n\u201cOur plan is to play him, our plan is to start him,\u201d Payton said of Brees, the veteran signal-caller who has missed four games with broken ribs and a punctured lung.\n\nThe Saints won three of four contests with backup Taysom Hill starting under center, securing a playoff berth.\n\nWatch LIVE coverage of the NFL Regular Season plus every single game of the Post-Season including Super Bowl LV with ESPN on Kayo.

We were encouraged at the start of the week.

If not, their Week 17 clash with Pittsburgh could be a play-in game.\n\nMiami (8-5, games left: vs Patriots, at Raiders, at Bills) holds seventh spot for now over Baltimore (8-5, games left: vs Jaguars, vs Giants, at Bengals), but as you can see from those schedules, the Ravens are in a great position to overtake them for the last AFC berth.\n\nAll four of the Titans, Browns, Colts and Ravens are given a better-than 86 per cent chance of making the playoffs from here by FPI. The Dolphins will need to avoid a stumble to knock one of them out.\n\nLas Vegas (7-7) is relying on the Dolphins and Ravens both collapsing following their Thursday Night Football loss to the Chargers, with New England (6-7) in the same boat.\n\nIn the NFC, Green Bay (10-3, games left: vs Panthers, vs Titans, at Bears) was the major beneficiary of the Saints\u2019 shock loss to Philadelphia in Week 14.\n\nThe Packers have sealed the NFC North title and hold the head-to-head tiebreaker over New Orleans (10-3, games left: vs Chiefs, vs Vikings, at Panthers); so if the Saints lose to the Chiefs this week, the race for the top seed will be close to done.\n\nLos Angeles (9-4, games left: vs Jets, at Seahawks, vs Cardinals) has the edge over Seattle (9-4, games left: at Washington, vs Rams, at 49ers) for the NFC West title, with a showdown looming in Week 16, but both teams can lock up a playoff berth with a Week 15 win.\n\nSuddenly Washington (6-7, games left: vs Seahawks, vs Panthers, at Eagles) has the inside running for the NFC East title, winning four in a row and watching the Giants start to slide.\n\nNew York (5-8, games left: vs Browns, at Ravens, vs Cowboys) has the tiebreaker over their divisional rivals thanks to their two head-to-head wins, but is a game back with a tougher remaining schedule. Philadelphia (4-8-1, games left: at Cardinals, at Cowboys, vs Washington) has a chance but needs to keep winning.\n\nTampa Bay (8-5, games left: at Falcons, at Lions, vs Falcons) can still win the NFC South if they win out and the Saints go 0-3, but realistically they\u2019re near-certainties to secure a wildcard spot and their first playoff berth since 2007.\n\nThe final wildcard spot currently belongs to Arizona (7-6, games left: vs Eagles, vs 49ers, at Rams), who have a one-game edge over the Vikings and Bears and a kinder schedule.\n\nMinnesota (6-7, games left: vs Bears, at Saints, at Lions) and Chicago (6-7, games left: at Vikings, at Jaguars, vs Packers) play each other in Week 15, which will virtually eliminate the loser, and each have a game against an NFC title contender left as well.", "topic": "sports", "tag": "headline", "types": [], "claim": "", "verdict": ""}, {"url": "https://www.news.com.au/sport/cricket/former-test-batsman-callum-ferguson-staggered-by-will-pucovski-concussion-call/news-story/d3ab059331c5cd1182eb4d3d4d37ea42", "source": "news.com.au", "authors": ["Nic Savage"], "title": "Former Test batsman Callum Ferguson \u2018staggered\u2019 by Will Pucovski concussion call - NEWS.com.au", "pubDate": "2020-12-20T08:43:46+00:00", "description": "Former Australian Test cricketer Callum Ferguson has questioned why Victorian batsman Will Pucovski has not been ruled out of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.", "imageUrl": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/dff055dc36365aa434cc7d08fd58f069?width=1280", "language": "en", "country": "au", "content": "Former Australian Test cricketer Callum Ferguson has questioned why Victorian batsman Will Pucovski has not been ruled out of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.\n\nPucovski was struck in the head by a bouncer during Australia A\u2019s tour match against India A at Drummoyne Oval earlier this month.\n\nIt was the 22-year-old\u2019s ninth reported concussion in six years.\n\nPucovski was withdrawn from contention the first Test against India, and remains in doubt for the Boxing Day clash at the MCG.\n\nHowever, Ferguson is \u201cstaggered\u201d the uncapped prodigy has not already been ruled out of the entire four-Test series.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t see them playing Pucovski.

Westbrook finished with 8 points, 7 rebounds, 3 assists and shot 4-for-10, including 0-for-3 from behind the arc.\n\n\"It was good,\" Westbrook said of his first game as a Wizard. \"We won, the most important part ... I like where we were tonight.\n\n\"My job is to try to set the tone. Have them be ready to play.\"\n\nThe Wizards saw Westbrook's influence on offense in the ability Bradley Beal had to work one-on-one against defenders and how much the Wizards tried to push the pace. Washington led by as much as 16 and had 10 fast-break points in the first half when Westbrook played.\n\n\"It just felt great,\" Beal said of playing with Westbrook. \"It was great energy ... I don't think it will be tough as people are trying to make it out to be. We both do a really good job off of feeding off of each other, just adjusting to how each other plays.\n\n\"The most important thing is his pace and energy he brings to the table ... it just works out well. We just continue to play off each other, feed off each other and push each other.\"\n\nWhile Beal missed all seven of his 3-point attempts, he scored 15 points and hit seven field goals. Beal averaged 30.5 points last season but drew the majority of the opposing defense's attention as the Wizards' lone star.\n\n\"Our job is to make the game easier for him,\" Westbrook said. \"Find a way to constantly feed him the ball so he can score at a high rate. He has shown he is able to do that. He is going to be great. I am not worried about Brad one bit.\"\n\nBryant benefited from the attention Westbrook drew, scoring 22 points and making 7 of 12 shots. And Wizards coach Scott Brooks loved seeing an animated Westbrook celebrating Bryant's dunk with the foul and encouraging the big man in the first quarter.\n\n\"Really good,\" Brooks said when asked about Westbrook's first preseason action. \"He's been looking like that all training camp. His spirit is about winning, not about stats. He plays the right way and teaches our young fellas the right things.

Venus currently has a surface temperature of 450\u2103 (the temperature of an oven\u2019s self-cleaning cycle) and an atmosphere dominated by carbon dioxide (96%) with a density 90 times that of Earth\u2019s.\n\nVenus is a very strange place, totally uninhabitable, except perhaps in the clouds some 60 kilometers up where the recent discovery of phosphine may suggest floating microbial life. But the surface is totally inhospitable.\n\nHowever, Venus once likely had an Earth-like climate. According to recent climate modelling, for much of its history Venus had surface temperatures similar to present-day Earth. It likely also had oceans, rain, perhaps snow, maybe continents and plate tectonics, and even more speculatively, perhaps even surface life.\n\nLess than one billion years ago, the climate dramatically changed due to a runaway greenhouse effect. It can be speculated that an intensive period of volcanism pumped enough carbon dioxide into the atmosphere to cause this great climate change event that evaporated the oceans and caused the end of the water cycle.\n\nThis hypothesis from the climate modelers inspired Sara Khawja, a master\u2019s student in my group (co-supervised with geoscientist Claire Samson), to look for evidence in Venusian rocks for this proposed climatic change event.\n\nSince the early 1990s, my Carleton University research team \u2014 and more recently my Siberian team at Tomsk State University \u2014 have been mapping and interpreting the geological and tectonic history of Earth\u2019s remarkable sister planet.\n\nSoviet Venera and Vega missions of the 1970s and 1980s did land on Venus and take pictures and evaluated the composition of the rocks before the landers failed due to the high temperature and pressure. However, our most comprehensive view of the surface of Venus has been provided by NASA\u2019s Magellan spacecraft in the early 1990s, which used radar to see through the dense cloud layer and produce detailed images of more than 98% of Venus\u2019s surface.\n\nOur search for geological evidence of the great climate change event led us to focus on the oldest type of rocks on Venus, called tesserae, which have a complex appearance suggestive of a long, complicated geological history. We thought that these oldest rocks had the best chance of preserving evidence of water erosion, which is such an important process on Earth and should have occurred on Venus prior to the great climate change event.\n\nGiven poor resolution altitude data, we used an indirect technique to try to recognize ancient river valleys. We demonstrated that younger lava flows from the surrounding volcanic plains had filled valleys in the margins of tesserae.\n\nTo our astonishment these tesserae valley patterns were very similar to river flow patterns on Earth, leading to our suggestion that these tesserae valleys were formed by river erosion during a time with Earth-like climatic conditions. My Venus research groups at Carleton and Tomsk State universities are studying the post-tesserae lava flows for any geological evidence of the transition to extremely hot conditions.\n\nIn order to understand how volcanism on Venus could produce such a change in climate, we can look to Earth history for analogs. We can find analogies in super-eruptions like the last eruption at Yellowstone that occurred 630,000 years.\n\nBut such volcanism is small compared to large igneous provinces (LIPs) that occur approximately every 20-30 million years. These eruption events can release enough carbon dioxide to cause catastrophic climate change on Earth, including mass extinctions. To give you a sense of scale, consider that the smallest LIPs produce enough magma to cover all of Canada to a depth of about 10 meters. The largest known LIP produced enough magma that would have covered an area the size of Canada to a depth of nearly eight kilometers.\n\nThe LIP analogs on Venus include individual volcanoes that are up to 500 kilometers across, extensive lava channels that reach up to 7,000 kilometers long, and there are also associated rift systems \u2014 where the crust is pulling apart \u2014 up to 10,000 kilometers long.\n\nIf LIP-style volcanism was the cause of the great climate change event on Venus, then could similar climate change happen on Earth? We can imagine a scenario many millions of years in the future when multiple LIPs randomly occurring at the same time could cause Earth to have such runaway climate change leading to conditions like present-day Venus.\n\nThis article by Richard Ernst, Scientist-in-Residence, Earth Sciences, Carleton University (also a professor at Tomsk State University, Russia), Carleton University is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

The first New Brunswicker who will get the vaccine is Pauline Gauvin, a resident of a long-term care facility in Miramichi, McCallum said.\n\nThe union representing ambulance drivers in New Brunswick raised concerns when some employees who received invitations to get the vaccine were denied because they were scheduled to work.\n\nMinister Shephard said she understands that people want the vaccine, but she said they also need to ensure the province is properly covered by ambulance service.\n\n\u201cThere are going to be some logistical requirements and planning that go along with this,\u201d she said. \u201cAmbulance New Brunswick is going to have to manage the paramedics they have on shifts and the paramedics distribution throughout the province.\u201d\n\nAndrew McLean, president of CUPE Local 4848, said he understands the position of both the government and his members. \u201cIt would not be ethical or appropriate to leave areas of the system out of service,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the province has accepted an offer from the owner of a bluefin tuna exporting company in eastern Prince Edward Island for a loan of two freezers that can store the vaccine, which has to be kept below -70 C.\n\nJason Tompkins, whose company last week lent two of its freezers to P.E.I., said the ultralow-temperature freezers will be shipped to New Brunswick Monday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a really unique situation \u2014 a small fishing company in North Lake, P.E.I. \u2014 and we just happen to have the equipment needed for this rollout,\u201d he said in an interview Friday. \u201cAs far as we were concerned it was just a case of do the right thing.\u201d\n\nTompkins said he\u2019s been flooded with cards, emails and phone calls from across the country from people who just want to say thank you.\n\nNew Brunswick reported no new cases of COVID-19 Friday, while Nova Scotia reported seven new infections.\n\nAll the new cases in Nova Scotia were in the Halifax area. Five involved close contacts of previously reported cases and two were related to travel outside Atlantic Canada.\n\nMeanwhile, the province said it will begin asking rotational, out-of-province workers to get two tests during their two-week period of self-isolation.\n\nThe province also said that starting Jan. 4, post-secondary students from outside Atlantic Canada who return to Nova Scotia after the holidays will be advised to get one COVID-19 test on day six, seven or eight of their 14-day required isolation period.\n\nNewfoundland and Labrador reported five new cases of COVID-19 Friday. Health officials said four of those infections are travel related and that the source of the fifth infection is under investigation.\n\nThe new infections brought the active caseload in Newfoundland and Labrador to 27, and officials said one person was in hospital with the disease.\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 18, 2020.", "topic": "health", "tag": "headline", "types": [], "claim": "", "verdict": ""}, {"url": "https://swiftcurrentonline.com/local/the-december-18-covid-19-update-from-the-sha", "source": "swiftcurrentonline.com", "authors": ["Penny Schreiner"], "title": "The December 18 COVID-19 Update From the SHA - SwiftCurrentOnline.com", "pubDate": "2020-12-18T20:47:20+00:00", "description": "SwiftcurrentOnline.com is Swift Current's only source for community news and information such as weather and classifieds.", "imageUrl": "https://www.swiftcurrentonline.com/images/News/pictures_2020/COVID_7_Day_Average_dec_18.jpg", "language": "en", "country": "ca", "content": "In the December 18 COVID-19 update from The Saskatchewan Health Authority they are reporting a total of 245 new cases of the virus in the province.\n\nOf those 245 new cases, there are 12 in the Far North West zone, 1 in the Far North Central zone, 28 in the Far North East zone, 53 in the North West zone, 16 in the North Central zone, 14 in the North East zone, 46 in the Saskatoon zone, 5 in the Central West zone, 4 in the Central East zone, and 42 in the Regina zone.\n\nThere are 2 new cases in the South West zone, 7 in the South Central zone, and 5 in the South East zone.\n\nThere are 10 new cases that have pending residence information.\n\nSeven previously reported cases with pending residence information have been assigned as follows: 1 to the Far North Central zone, and 6 to the North Central zone.\n\nThe seven-day average of daily new cases is 230 (19 new cases per 100,000 population.)\n\nThat brings the provincial number of COVID-19 cases to 13,077, of which 3,736 are considered active.\n\nThere are currently 27 active cases in the South West zone.\n\nThere have been 485 recoveries reported today, bringing that provincial total to 9,234.\n\nTwo residents who tested positive for COVID-19 have died.

It will serve all of Simcoe County and Muskoka District.\n\n\u201cBoy, am I glad we kept that building,\u201d said Lehman. \u201cIt\u2019s been put to such good use.\u201d\n\nHe said the vaccine\u2019s arrival is now his favourite science-based Christmas present, moving the telescope he received when he was six years old to second place on that list.\n\nGardner said the vaccine roll-out will follow priorities established by the province through its pilot program. Since the Pfizer vaccine can\u2019t be moved, the first to be inoculated in Simcoe-Muskoka will be those working at long-term care homes.\n\nHe said the health unit has already been in contact with homes in the region to ask for staff who are interested in early vaccination. They will, however, not be required to receive the vaccination.\n\nThe goal, noted Gardner, is to inoculate 40 per cent of staff in a home.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s totally appropriate,\u201d he said of the province\u2019s prioritization of long-term care staff. \u201cThat\u2019s where we\u2019ve seen the most severe disease. Often \u2014 and not to anyone\u2019s fault \u2014 it\u2019s brought in through staff who are asymptomatic because, as members of the community, they are vulnerable to transmission. If we can protect them by vaccinating them, we can, by extension, protect the residents.\u201d\n\nThe Pfizer vaccine has to be given in two doses 21 days apart.\n\n\u201cFrom a hospital perspective, this couldn\u2019t have come soon enough,\u201d said Skot. \u201cWe can see there is a light at (the end of) this very long, 10-month tunnel.\u201d\n\nRVH has been offering support to and receiving patients from other hospitals in the region, and Skot said they have also taken \u201cover a dozen\u201d patients from the GTA area.\n\n\u201cThose hospitals are so inundated \u2026 They really need our help,\u201d she said.\n\nAll three officials stressed the need for residents of the region to keep their guard up and continue physical distancing, hand washing, wearing masks and limiting close contact to household members only.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a reality in hockey that the time where you\u2019re most vulnerable to having a goal scored against you is the 30 seconds after you score a goal,\u201d said Lehman. \u201cThis was a huge goal for the world and a wonderful moment for our community, but we are at great risk at the moment.\u201d\n\nGardner encouraged people to \u201credouble their efforts\u201d in preventing the spread of the virus.", "topic": "health", "tag": "headline", "types": [], "claim": "", "verdict": ""}, {"url": "https://winnipeg.citynews.ca/2020/12/19/covid-19-vaccinations-now-underway-in-all-provinces-as-new-brunswick-gives-1st-shot/", "source": "winnipeg.citynews.ca", "authors": [], "title": "COVID-19 vaccinations now underway in all provinces as New Brunswick gives 1st shot - CityNews Winnipeg", "pubDate": "2020-12-19T15:28:12+00:00", "description": "", "imageUrl": "https://winnipeg.citynews.ca/wp-content/blogs.dir/sites/13/2020/12/Vaccine-scaled-1024x684.jpg", "language": "en", "country": "ca", "content": "Immunizations for COVID-19 are now officially underway in all provinces, while cases remain high in those hit hardest by the pandemic.\n\nThe last province to launch its inoculation program, New Brunswick, delivered its first COVID-19 vaccine this morning, to an 84-year-old resident of a long-term care facility.\n\nOther residents and health-care workers were also set to get the shot today, part of the province\u2019s plan to administer the the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to 1,950 people.\n\nMeanwhile, Ontario recorded more than 2,000 positive tests for a fifth consecutive day as the provincial government began emergency talks to consider additional health measures.\n\nThe province reported 2,357 new cases today, and 27 new deaths.\n\nThe latest national tally, reported Friday evening, was 495,346, which includes 14,040 deaths and 405,611 cases considered resolved.\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 19, 2020.", "topic": "health", "tag": "headline", "types": [], "claim": "", "verdict": ""}, {"url": "https://www.wellandtribune.ca/ts/news/world/us/2020/12/20/2nd-covid-19-vaccine-authorized-in-us-preparing-to-ship-out.html", "source": "wellandtribune.ca", "authors": [], "title": "2nd COVID-19 vaccine authorized in US preparing to ship out - WellandTribune.ca", "pubDate": "2020-12-20T13:07:15+00:00", "description": "OLIVE BRANCH, Miss. - Initial shipments of the second COVID-19 vaccine authorized in the U.S. left a distribution centre Sunday, a desperately needed ...", "imageUrl": "https://images.thestar.com/1XN6ZcD-5fwvuhzKSGQGiIQKrfo=/1280x1024/smart/filters:cb(1608486000084)/https://www.wellandtribune.ca/content/dam/thestar/news/world/us/2020/12/20/2nd-covid-19-vaccine-authorized-in-us-is-shipped-out/MSPS103-1220_2020_121502.jpg", "language": "en", "country": "ca", "content": "OLIVE BRANCH, Miss. - Initial shipments of the second COVID-19 vaccine authorized in the U.S. left a distribution centre Sunday, a desperately needed boost as the nation works to bring the coronavirus pandemic under control.\n\nThe trucks left the Memphis-area factory with the vaccine developed by Moderna Inc. and the National Institutes of Health. The much-needed shots are expected to be given starting Monday, just three days after the Food and Drug Administration authorized their emergency rollout.\n\nAlso on Sunday, an expert committee began considering who should be next in line for early doses of the Moderna vaccine and a similar one from Pfizer Inc. and Germany\u2019s BioNTech. Pfizer\u2019s shots were first shipped out a week ago and started being used the next day, kicking off the nation\u2019s biggest vaccination drive.\n\nPublic health experts say the shots \u2014 and others in the pipeline \u2014 are the only way to stop a virus that has been spreading wildly. Nationwide, more than 219,000 people per day on average test positive for the virus, which has killed at least 314,000 in the U.S. and upwards of 1.7 million worldwide.\n\nThe Pfizer and Moderna shots shipped so far and going out over the next few weeks are nearly all going to health care workers and residents of long-term care homes, based on the advice of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.\n\nThere won\u2019t be enough shots for the general population until spring, so doses will be rationed at least for the next several months. President-elect Joe Biden pledged earlier this month to have 100 million vaccine doses distributed in his first 100 days in office, and his surgeon general nominee said Sunday that it\u2019s still a realistic goal.\n\nBut Vivek Murthy, speaking on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d said it\u2019s more realistic to think it may be midsummer or early fall before coronavirus vaccines are available to the general population, rather than late spring. Murthy said Biden\u2019s team is working toward having the shots available to lower-risk individuals by late spring but doing so requires \u201ceverything to go exactly on schedule.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s more realistic to assume that it may be closer to mid-summer or early fall when this vaccine makes its way to the general population,\u201d Murthy said. \u201cSo, we want to be optimistic, but we want to be cautious as well.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Trump\u2019s surgeon general, Jerome Adams, defended the administration\u2019s handling of the Pfizer vaccine Sunday, a day after the Army general charge of getting COVID-19 vaccines across the U.S. apologized Saturday for \u201cmiscommunication\u201d with states over the number of doses to be delivered in the early stages of distribution. At least a dozen states reported they would receive a smaller second shipment of the Pfizer vaccine than they had been told previously.\n\nGen. Gustave Perna told reporters in a telephone briefing that he made mistakes by citing numbers of doses that he believed would be ready.\n\nBut Adams, speaking on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation,\u201c said that \u201cthe numbers are going to go up and down.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt absolutely was not poor planning,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s what we plan. There\u2019s what we actually allocate. There\u2019s what\u2019s delivered, and then there\u2019s what\u2019s actually put in people\u2019s arms.\u201d\n\nAdams, who is Black, said he understands that mistrust of the medical community and the vaccine among Blacks \u201ccomes from a real place,\u201d the mistreatment of communities of colour. He cited the decades-long Tuskegee experiment in Alabama, where Black men with syphilis were not treated so the disease could be studied.\n\nHe also said immigrants in the U.S. illegally should not be denied the vaccine because of their legal status because \u201cit\u2019s not ethically right to deny those individuals.\u201d\n\nThe expert panel members are leaning toward putting \u201cessential workers\u201d next in line, because people like bus drivers, grocery store clerks and others are getting infected most often. But other experts say people 65 and older should be next, along with people with certain medical conditions, because those are the Americans who are dying at the highest rates.\n\nThe expert panel\u2019s advice is almost always endorsed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. No matter what the CDC says, there will be differences from state to state, because various health departments have different ideas about who should be closer to the front of the line.\n\nBoth the Moderna vaccine and the Pfizer-BioNTech shot require two doses several weeks apart.

(AP) \u2014 Initial shipments of the second COVID-19 vaccine authorized in the U.S. left a distribution center Sunday, a desperately needed boost as the nation works to bring the coronavirus pandemic under control.\n\nThe trucks left the Memphis-area factory with the vaccine developed by Moderna Inc. and the National Institutes of Health. The much-needed shots are expected to be given starting Monday, just three days after the Food and Drug Administration authorized their emergency rollout.\n\nAlso on Sunday, an expert committee began considering who should be next in line for early doses of the Moderna vaccine and a similar one from Pfizer Inc. and Germany\u2019s BioNTech. Pfizer's shots were first shipped out a week ago and started being used the next day, kicking off the nation\u2019s biggest vaccination drive.\n\nPublic health experts say the shots \u2014 and others in the pipeline \u2014 are the only way to stop a virus that has been spreading wildly. Nationwide, more than 219,000 people per day on average test positive for the virus, which has killed at least 314,000 in the U.S. and upwards of 1.7 million worldwide.\n\nThe Pfizer and Moderna shots shipped so far and going out over the next few weeks are nearly all going to health care workers and residents of long-term care homes, based on the advice of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.\n\nThere won\u2019t be enough shots for the general population until spring, so doses will be rationed at least for the next several months. President-elect Joe Biden pledged earlier this month to have 100 million vaccine doses distributed in his first 100 days in office, and his surgeon general nominee said Sunday that it's still a realistic goal.\n\nBut Vivek Murthy, speaking on NBC's \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d said it's more realistic to think it may be midsummer or early fall before coronavirus vaccines are available to the general population, rather than late spring. Murthy said Biden\u2019s team is working toward having the shots available to lower-risk individuals by late spring but doing so requires \u201ceverything to go exactly on schedule.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s more realistic to assume that it may be closer to mid-summer or early fall when this vaccine makes its way to the general population,\u201d Murthy said. \u201cSo, we want to be optimistic, but we want to be cautious as well.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Trump's surgeon general, Jerome Adams, defended the administration's handling of the Pfizer vaccine Sunday, a day after the Army general charge of getting COVID-19 vaccines across the U.S. apologized Saturday for \u201cmiscommunication\u201d with states over the number of doses to be delivered in the early stages of distribution. At least a dozen states reported they would receive a smaller second shipment of the Pfizer vaccine than they had been told previously.\n\nGen. Gustave Perna told reporters in a telephone briefing that he made mistakes by citing numbers of doses that he believed would be ready.\n\nBut Adams, speaking on CBS' \u201cFace the Nation,\" said that \u201cthe numbers are going to go up and down.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt absolutely was not poor planning,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s what we plan. There\u2019s what we actually allocate. There\u2019s what\u2019s delivered, and then there\u2019s what\u2019s actually put in people\u2019s arms.\u201d\n\nAdams, who is Black, said he understands that mistrust of the medical community and the vaccine among Blacks \u201ccomes from a real place,\u201d the mistreatment of communities of color. He cited the decades-long Tuskegee experiment in Alabama, where Black men with syphilis were not treated so the disease could be studied.\n\nHe also said immigrants in the U.S. illegally should not be denied the vaccine because of their legal status because \u201cit\u2019s not ethically right to deny those individuals.\u201d\n\nThe expert panel members are leaning toward putting \u201cessential workers\u201d next in line, because people like bus drivers, grocery store clerks and others are getting infected most often. But other experts say people 65 and older should be next, along with people with certain medical conditions, because those are the Americans who are dying at the highest rates.\n\nThe expert panel\u2019s advice is almost always endorsed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. No matter what the CDC says, there will be differences from state to state, because various health departments have different ideas about who should be closer to the front of the line.\n\nBoth the Moderna vaccine and the Pfizer-BioNTech shot require two doses several weeks apart.

Positive COVID-19 test results are reported to the health department immediately after they are confirmed, but negative test results may not be reported for 24 to 72 hours. The total number of cases reported by the Utah Department of Health each day includes all cases of COVID-19 since Utah's outbreak began, including those who are currently infected, those who have recovered from the disease, and those who have died. Recovered cases are defined as anyone who was diagnosed with COVID-19 three or more weeks ago and has not died. Referral hospitals are the 16 Utah hospitals with the capability to provide the best COVID-19 health care. Deaths reported by the state typically occurred two to seven days prior to when they are reported, according to the health department. Some deaths may be from even further back, especially if the person is from Utah but has died in another state. The health department reports both confirmed and probable COVID-19 case deaths per the case definition outlined by the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists. The death counts are subject to change as case investigations are completed. For deaths that are reported as COVID-19 deaths, the person would not have died if they did not have COVID-19, according to the health department.

While the diplomats were there to finalize deals to ensure millions of doses reached Indonesian citizens, the clerics had a much different concern: Whether the COVID-19 vaccine was permissible for use under Islamic law.\n\nAs companies race to develop a COVID-19 vaccine and countries scramble to secure doses, questions about the use of pork products \u2014 banned by some religious groups \u2014 has raised concerns about the possibility of disrupted immunization campaigns.\n\nPork-derived gelatin has been widely used as a stabilizer to ensure vaccines remain safe and effective during storage and transport. Some companies have worked for years to develop pork-free vaccines: Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis has produced a pork-free meningitis vaccine, while Saudi- and Malaysia-based AJ Pharma is currently working on one of their own.\n\nBut demand, existing supply chains, cost and the shorter shelf life of vaccines not containing porcine gelatin means the ingredient is likely to continue to be used in a majority of vaccines for years, said Dr. Salman Waqar, general secretary of the British Islamic Medical Association.\n\nSpokespeople for Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca have said that pork products are not part of their COVID-19 vaccines. But limited supply and preexisting deals worth millions of dollars with other companies means that some countries with large Muslim populations, such as Indonesia, will receive vaccines that have not yet been certified to be gelatin-free.\n\nThis presents a dilemma for religious communities, including Orthodox Jews and Muslims, where the consumption of pork products is deemed religiously unclean, and how the ban is applied to medicine, he said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a difference of opinion amongst Islamic scholars as to whether you take something like pork gelatin and make it undergo a rigorous chemical transformation,\" Waqar said. \u201cIs that still considered to be religiously impure for you to take?\u201d\n\nThe majority consensus from past debates over pork gelatin use in vaccines is that it is permissible under Islamic law, as \u201cgreater harm\u201d would occur if the vaccines weren\u2019t used, said Dr. Harunor Rashid, an associate professor at the University of Sydney.\n\nThere's a similar assessment by a broad consensus of religious leaders in the Orthodox Jewish community as well.\n\n\u201cAccording to the Jewish law, the prohibition on eating pork or using pork is only forbidden when it\u2019s a natural way of eating it,\u201d said Rabbi David Stav, chairman of Tzohar, a rabbinical organization in Israel.\n\nIf \u201cit\u2019s injected into the body, not (eaten) through the mouth,\" then there is \u201cno prohibition and no problem, especially when we are concerned about sicknesses,\u201d he said.\n\nYet there have been dissenting opinions on the issue \u2014 some with serious health consequences for Indonesia, which has the world's largest Muslim population, some 225 million.\n\nIn 2018, the Indonesian Ulema Council, the Muslim clerical body that issues certifications that a product is halal, or permissible under Islamic law, decreed that the measles and rubella vaccines were \u201charam,\u201d or unlawful, because of the gelatin. Religious and community leaders began to urge parents to not allow their children to be vaccinated.\n\n\u201cMeasles cases subsequently spiked, giving Indonesia the third-highest rate of measles in the world,\u201d said Rachel Howard, director of the health care market research group Research Partnership.\n\nA decree was later issued by the Muslim clerical body saying it was permissible to receive the vaccine, but cultural taboos still led to continued low vaccination rates, Howard said.\n\n\u201cOur studies have found that some Muslims in Indonesia feel uncomfortable with accepting vaccinations containing these ingredients,\" even when the Muslim authority issues guidelines saying they are permitted, she said.\n\nGovernments have taken steps to address the issue. In Malaysia, where the halal status of vaccines has been identified as the biggest issue among Muslim parents, stricter laws have been enacted so that parents must vaccinate their children or face fines and jail time. In Pakistan, where there has been waning vaccine confidence for religious and political reasons, parents have been jailed for refusing to vaccinate their children against polio.\n\nBut with rising vaccine hesitancy and misinformation spreading around the globe, including in religious communities, Rashid said community engagement is \u201cabsolutely necessary.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt could be disastrous,\u201d if there is not strong community engagement from governments and health care workers, he said.\n\nIn Indonesia, the government has already said it will include the Muslim clerical body in the COVID-19 vaccine procurement and certification process.\n\n\u201cPublic communication regarding the halal status, price, quality and distribution must be well-prepared,\u201d Indonesian President Joko Widodo said in October.\n\nWhile they were in China in the fall, the Indonesian clerics inspected China's Sinovac Biotech facilities, and clinical trials involving some 1,620 volunteers are also underway in Indonesia for the company's vaccine. The government has announced several COVID-19 vaccine procurement deals with the company totaling millions of doses.\n\nSinovac Biotech, as well as Chinese companies Sinopharm and CanSino Biologics \u2014 which all have COVID-19 vaccines in late-stage clinical trials and deals selling millions of doses around the world \u2014 did not respond to Associated Press requests for ingredient information.\n\nIn China, none of the COVID-19 vaccines has been granted final market approval, but more than 1 million health care workers and others who have been deemed at high risk of infection have received vaccines under emergency use permission. The companies have yet to disclose how effective the vaccines are or possible side effects.\n\nPakistan is late-stage clinical trials of the CanSino Biologics vaccine. Bangladesh previously had an agreement with Sinovac Biotech to conduct clinical trials in the country, but the trials have been delayed due to a funding dispute. Both countries have some of the largest Muslim populations in the world.\n\nWhile health care workers on the ground in Indonesia are still largely engaged in efforts to contain the virus as numbers continue to surge, Waqar said government efforts to reassure Indonesians will be key to a successful immunization campaign as COVID-19 vaccines are approved for use.\n\nBut, he said, companies producing the vaccines must also be part of such community outreach.\n\n\u201cThe more they are transparent, the more they are open and honest about their product, the more likely it is that there are communities that have confidence in the product and will be able to have informed discussions about what it is they want to do,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBecause, ultimately, it is the choice of individuals.\u201d\n\nAssociated Press writers Edna Tarigan in Jakarta, Indonesia, and Ilan Ben Zion in Jerusalem contributed to this report.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

What foods are vitamin D found in? What are the harms of high vitamin D levels? all in the details of the news ...\n\nWhat are the symptoms of vitamin D deficiency?\n\nVitamin D deficiency affects all systems of the body and invites many diseases. Today's living conditions, working indoors, not performing outdoor activities enough, malnutrition increase vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D deficiency is a factor that affects all age groups and causes important health problems.\n\nVitamin D deficiency can occur with various symptoms. The important detail here is that people watch themselves and take the necessary precautions. Vitamin D deficiency symptoms can be listed as follows:\n\nWhat are the causes of vitamin D deficiency?\n\nVitamin D deficiency can occur in the following situations;\n\u2022 Not spending enough time in ultraviolet B (UVB) sunlight\n\nWhat happens with vitamin D deficiency?\n\nInsufficient sunbathing and small amounts of vitamin D in natural foods Vitamin D deficiency It is one of the common causes. In response to the question 'What happens with insufficient vitamin D intake?'\n\u2022 A bone disease called osteomalasia seen in adulthood can be seen.\n\u2022 When vitamin D deficiency leads to bone diseases, muscle and bone pain may be experienced, and they may be more likely to break or break a bone.\n\u2022 Not getting enough vitamin D in babies and children can lead to rickets that cause growth retardation, muscle weakness, and skeletal deformities.\n\u2022 Vitamin D helps your immune system function well. As a matter of fact, fighting against diseases may be insufficient in vitamin D deficiency.\n\u2022 It prepares the ground for obesity.\n\u2022 It can prepare the ground for Alzheimer's disease.\n\u2022 It can lead to chronic fatigue at any time of the day.\n\nWhat diseases does vitamin D deficiency cause?\n\nIn people with vitamin D deficiency; It can cause health problems such as cancer, chronic fatigue, diabetes, hypertension, depression, rheumatism and heart diseases. Vitamin D deficiency; It also negatively affects bone density and invites bone diseases.\n\nBones have a lively structure just like other tissues, and long-term vitamin D deficiency can cause deterioration in bone structure, bone resorption and muscle weakness. Depending on vitamin D, rickets in children, bone softening in adults, and osteoporosis can occur in later ages. Rickets refers to the softening and weakening of the bones due to vitamin D deficiency. This disease may cause permanent defects in the bone structure such as curvature of the legs, thickening of the hands and ankles, growth retardation, and breast bone deformity.\n\nIn vitamin D deficiency, bone pain can be seen with bone resorption and this can be felt in the whole body. Later, weakness may accompany these pains. Foods containing omega-3, calcium, magnesium, potassium and vitamin D should be consumed to strengthen bones. In order to prevent osteoporosis that manifests itself in later ages, it is necessary to eat a healthy diet and maintain the vitamin D level together with other vitamins. Breast milk consumption in infancy is of great importance in order to avoid bone problems in later years.\n\nProblems such as diabetes, stroke, heart-related death risk, high blood pressure are also among the health problems that can be caused by vitamin D deficiency.\n\nVitamin D deficiency can trigger cancer formation. Breast cancer in particular is thought to be linked to vitamin D deficiency. Women who have breast cancer and have a high vitamin D value have a longer life expectancy than those with a lower value. Increasing the vitamin D level of people with breast cancer to 50 ng / ml and above affects the treatment positively.\n\nSince vitamin D increases communication between cells, it prevents them from dividing rapidly. By preventing the abnormal proliferation of cells, it accelerates the blood flow and slows down the feeding of cancer cells. Since the harmful cells cannot be fed, they disappear after a while.\n\nThe vitamin D levels of women living indoors are around 17 ng / ml. In women without cancer, the vitamin D level should be at least around 30 ng / ml. When the vitamin D level rises to 50 ng / ml and above, the risk of developing breast cancer decreases by 50%.\n\nAccording to researches, vitamin D deficiency also increases the risk of lung, colon and prostate cancer besides breast cancer.\n\nWhat are the harms of vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy?\n\nVitamin D deficiency also manifests itself in gynecological diseases and birth. Vitamin D use is extremely important for maternal and child health during pregnancy. Since the baby in the womb meets the need for calcium from the mother, the vitamin D level must be sufficient to maintain the calcium balance of the mother during pregnancy and breastfeeding. The bones of babies of mothers with vitamin D deficiency may soften and weaken. Weakness of the baby's muscles, closing or not closing the fontanelle, weakness in teething are also associated with vitamin D deficiency. Deficient vitamin D intake during pregnancy can cause permanent damage in newborn babies and cannot be completely corrected by vitamin supplements after birth.\n\n In vitamin D deficiency, there may be an increase in the risk of preeclampsia / eclampsia called pregnancy poisoning in expectant mothers. Fatigue, insufficient weight gain, fatigue, muscle and bone pain during pregnancy are also related to vitamin D. Also, gestational diabetes and osteoporosis In vitamin D deficiency are among the situations that may occur. Cesarean delivery is more common in mothers with low vitamin D levels. Vitamin D supplementation should be started from the 12th week for expectant mothers and continued until the 6th month of the breastfeeding period.\n\nPeople at risk of diseases seen in vitamin D deficiency:\n\u2022 Those who work indoors and wear closed\n\u2022 Those who use high factor sunscreen\n\u2022 Those with kidney and liver diseases\n\u2022 Those who have stomach surgery\n\nHow many should vitamin D be?\n\n* Extremely Low Vitamin D Level: below 30 nmol / L (12 ng / mL)\n\n * Slightly Low Vitamin D Level: between 30 nmol / L (12 ng / mL) and 50 nmol / L (20 ng / mL)\n\n * Normal Vitamin D Level: between 50 nmol / L (20 ng / mL) to 125 nmol / L (50 ng / mL)\n\n * High Vitamin D Level: higher than 125 nmol / L (50 ng / mL)\n\nWhat is the daily vitamin D requirement?\n\nThe need for vitamin D varies according to age and person. While 1 IU is sufficient for babies up to 400 year old, 1 IU should be taken after 600 year of age. After the age of 70, the daily need for vitamin D increases. Low vitamin D levels can lead to a range of problems, particularly those related to bones and muscles.\n\nWhat are the benefits of vitamin D?\n\nVitamin D is the vitamin that balances the blood levels of phosphorus and calcium substances. It is extremely important for dental and bone health. While it ensures the absorption of calcium in the intestines, it also reduces calcium loss in the kidneys. The hardening of bones with calcium accumulation occurs with vitamin D. Since it increases muscle strength and muscle mass, it reduces falls, especially in the elderly. It prevents the secretion of parathyroid hormone that causes bone resorption. For muscle and bone health, it is extremely important to pay attention to vitamin intake and diet.\n\nVitamin D has the ability to protect against diabetes. It is seen that Type 1 diabetes decreases in children who have enough vitamin D, and Type 2 diabetes increases in those with low levels. In addition, conditions such as metabolic syndrome occur in people with vitamin D deficiency.\n\nVitamin D is among the vitamins that strengthen the immune system. Providing protection against diseases by strengthening immunity, vitamin D is beneficial for all cells in the body. Low vitamin D is found in diseases caused by the immune system such as ulcerative colitis, Crohn's, Multiple Sclerosis (MS). It is seen that these diseases can be prevented with sufficient vitamin D.\n\nVitamin D is good for heart health and diseases. It has a protective effect against diseases related to high blood pressure, heart diseases and some types of cancer.\n\nWhat is vitamin D found in?\n\nThe most important source of vitamin D that the body needs is sunlight. In other words, the sun, which causes many skin diseases, has health benefits as well as health benefits. 95% of the vitamin D required for the body is provided by ultraviolet rays in the sun, and the rest is provided by food. For this, the skin must be exposed to direct sunlight. Sun exposure over clothes or behind windows is not effective in eliminating vitamin D deficiency. Likewise, sunscreens of a factor of 20 or more used while sunbathing also prevent the production of vitamin D in the skin. Since indoor environments cause vitamin D deficiency, it is more important to go outdoors. The reason why vitamin D deficiency is seen at almost every age is the inability to benefit from the sun sufficiently. Since prolonged exposure to the midday sun may have negative effects, especially on hot summer days, it will be good to go out in the morning and afternoon hours. Sunlight requirements may vary depending on the skin color, age and sunbathing style of the person. People with dark skin need sunlight for a longer time, especially in winter, in order for sufficient vitamin D to form on the skin.\n\nWhat foods are vitamin D found in?\n\nIn order not to experience vitamin D deficiency in months or regions where the sun is scarce, it is necessary to add foods containing vitamin D to the diet and diet. The following foods can be listed as an answer to the question of what vitamin D contains:\n\nBefore taking vitamin D supplements (vitamin D drugs), a doctor should be consulted and an appropriate vitamin D deficiency treatment should be performed. The diagnosis of vitamin D deficiency is made by measuring the vitamin D level in the blood. Oral treatment is recommended for those who cannot meet their daily needs. Higher doses of vitamin D supplements can be administered by injection from the hip. According to researches, when vitamin D pill or vitamin D drops are taken with fatty meals, the absorption of the vitamin is higher.\n\nWhat are the harms of high vitamin D levels?\n\nToo much of everything is harmful to the body. The same is true for the amount of vitamin D, and too much can lead to poisoning.\n\nThe high level range for vitamin D stored in fat and not excreted in urine is 125 nmol / l or more. High vitamin D levels can lead to calcium deposits in organs and soft tissues. The haphazard use of vitamin D can result in high blood levels. The damages of using too much vitamin D can be listed as follows.\n\u2022 It can lead to kidney stone formation and kidney damage.\n\u2022 It can lead to hypertension\n\u2022 It can cause an increase in calcium in the blood.\n\nOn the other hand, excess vitamin D can lead to poisoning and kidney failure and heart failure that develop as a result of this poisoning can lead to death. Early toxicity (intoxication) symptoms can be seen as bone pain, dizziness, dry mouth, constipation, persistent headache, thirst, myalgia, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and irregular heartbeat. Symptoms of chronic toxicity may manifest themselves with skin itching, nausea, sexual reluctance, severe stomach pain, psychiatric problems, bone pain, cloudiness in urine, eyes sensitive to light, vomiting.\n\nNote: Since sunlight destroys the excess vitamin D, vitamin D poisoning does not occur with sunbathing.", "topic": "health", "tag": "headline", "types": [], "claim": "", "verdict": ""}, {"url": "http://www.china.org.cn/world/Off_the_Wire/2020-12/19/content_77030130.htm", "source": "china.org.cn", "authors": [], "title": "Georgia reports 2,904 new COVID-19 cases_china.org.cn - China.org.cn", "pubDate": "2020-12-19T08:34:08+00:00", "description": "", "imageUrl": "", "language": "en", "country": "au", "content": "You are here:\n\nTBILISI, Dec. 19 (Xinhua) -- Georgia reported 2,904 new COVID-19 cases on Saturday, bringing its total to 206,907, according to the country's National Center for Disease Control and Public Health.\n\nAmong the new cases, 1,252 were confirmed in the capital city of Tbilisi, the center said.\n\nAs of Saturday, a total of 175,842 patients have recovered, while 2,055 others have died, it added.\n\nGeorgia reported its first confirmed case on Feb. 26.

The study has been published in the journal Cancer Research.\n\nOvarian and endometrial cancer are among the most common gynaecological cancers, with a lifetime risk of just over 2 per cent. Endometrial cancer is slightly more common but as it has clearer symptoms and is therefore often detected at an early stage, the mortality rate is low. However, ovarian cancer is among the deadliest cancers, since it is often not detected until it has already spread to other parts of the body.\n\nThe first oral contraceptive pill was approved already in the 1960s, and 80 per cent of all women in Western Europe have used oral contraceptives at some point in their life. Oral contraceptives include oestrogen and progestin, which are synthetic forms of female sex hormones. The oestrogen and progestin in oral contraceptives prevent ovulation and thereby protect against pregnancy.\n\nIn the current study, the scientists compared the incidence of breast, ovarian and endometrial cancers between women that had used oral contraceptive pills and never users.\n\n\"It was clear that women who had used oral contraceptive pills had a much lower risk of developing both ovarian and endometrial cancer. Fifteen years after discontinuing oral contraceptives, the risk was about 50 per cent lower. However, a decreased risk was still detected up to 30-35 years after discontinuation,\" says Asa Johansson at the Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Uppsala University, one of the leading researchers behind the study.\n\nHowever, oral contraceptive pills have previously been associated with an increased risk of breast cancer.\n\n\"Surprisingly, we only found a small increased risk of breast cancer among oral contraceptive users, and the increased risk disappeared within a few years after discontinuation,\" says Johansson. \"Our results suggest that the lifetime risk of breast cancer might not differ between ever and never users, even if there is an increased short-term risk.\"The results from the current study are important since oral contraceptive use has commonly been associated with side effects such as deep vein thrombosis and breast cancer.\n\n\"In addition to protecting against pregnancy, we have shown that oral contraceptive pills also have other positive effects. Our results can enable women and physicians to make more informed decisions about which women should use oral contraceptive pills,\" says Therese Johansson, one of the PhD students behind the study.

We've looked into some of the most widely shared.\n\nBBC News footage is being passed off as \"proof\" on social media that Covid-19 vaccines are fake, and that press events showing people being injected have been staged.\n\nThe clip, from a report which aired on BBC TV this week, is being shared by anti-vaccine campaigners. They claim fake syringes with \"disappearing needles\" are being used in an attempt by the authorities to promote a vaccine that doesn't exist.\n\nOne version posted on Twitter has had more than 20,000 retweets and likes, and half a million views. Another major spreader of the video has been suspended.\n\nThe posts use genuine footage showing healthcare professionals using a safety syringe, in which the needle retracts into the body of the device after use.\n\nSafety syringes have been in widespread use for over a decade. They protect medical staff and patients from injuries and infection.\n\nIt's not the first time claims of fake needles have appeared since vaccine roll out began.\n\nOne showed an Australian politician posing with a syringe next to her arm, the needle clearly covered with a safety cap, with claims that her Covid-19 vaccination had been faked.\n\nBut in reality, it showed Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk posing for the cameras after receiving a flu vaccine in April. The video has had close to 400,000 views on Twitter.\n\nPhotographers had asked for more photos because the real injection happened too quickly.\n\nNo nurse has died in Alabama\n\nPublic Health authorities in Alabama released a statement condemning \"misinformation\" after a false story that a nurse died after taking the coronavirus vaccine spread on Facebook.\n\nThe state had just started injecting its first citizens with the jab.\n\nAfter being alerted to the rumours, the department of public health contacted all vaccine-administering hospitals in the state and \"confirmed there have been no deaths of vaccine recipients. The posts are untrue.\"\n\nThe story emerged with Facebook posts saying one of the first nurses - a woman in her 40s - to receive the Covid vaccine in Alabama, was found dead. But there's no evidence this has happened.\n\nOne user said it happened to her \"friend's aunt\" and posted text message conversations she said she'd exchanged with the friend.\n\nSome of the original posts about the nurse are no longer online, but screenshots are still being shared and commented on. One of these suggests the incident took place in the city of Tuscaloosa, Alabama.\n\nThe city hospital told us the very first Covid vaccine was only administered on the morning of 17 December - after the reference to Tuscaloosa was mentioned on Facebook.\n\nAs of 00:30 on 18 December, the US Centers for Disease Control say they have received no reports of death anywhere in the country following the coronavirus vaccine.\n\nThe posts have been labelled \"false\" on Facebook but some people claim without evidence that the \"powers that be are already trying to cover it up\".\n\nA 30-minute video which went live as the first people in the UK received the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine, contains a host of false and unsubstantiated claims about the pandemic.\n\nThe film, called \"Ask the experts\", features around 30 contributors from several countries, including the UK, US, Belgium and Sweden. Covid-19 is described by one of these people as the \"greatest hoax in history\".\n\nIt begins with the claims that there is \"not a real medical pandemic\", and that the coronavirus vaccine is not proven safe or effective because there \"has not been enough time\".\n\nBoth of these claims are untrue.\n\nThe BBC has written at length about how any vaccine approved for use against coronavirus will have been rigorously tested for safety and efficacy. It's true Covid-19 vaccines have been developed at a remarkable pace, but none of the steps needed to ensure safety have been skipped.\n\n\"The only difference is that some of the stages overlapped so, for example, phase three of the trial - when tens of thousands of people are given the vaccine - started while phase two, involving a few hundred people, was still going on,\" says BBC Health reporter Rachel Schraer.\n\nOther participants in the video who appear on screen repeat the same unfounded claims.\n\nWe also hear inaccurate theories about the technology behind Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine. And that, because of the pandemic, the pharmaceutical industry has been given permission to \"skip the animal trials...we humans will be the guinea pigs.\"\n\nThis is false. The Pfizer BioNTech, Moderna and Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccines have all been tested in animals as well as thousands of people, before they could be considered for licensing.\n\nThe video was posted on a hosting platform that positions itself as an alternative to YouTube, says Olga Robinson, a disinformation expert from BBC Monitoring.\n\n\"Promising low content moderation, sites like this have in the past months become a go-to place for those users kicked off major social media platforms for spreading misinformation.\"", "topic": "health", "tag": "headline", "types": [], "claim": "", "verdict": ""}, {"url": "https://www.jacksonprogress-argus.com/news/world_nation/in-california-wealthy-patients-are-offering-top-dollar-to-cut-the-line-for-a-covid/article_8e3906e3-2edd-58f4-be2b-644d2afe0422.html", "source": "jacksonprogress-argus.com", "authors": ["Jenn Selva, CNN"], "title": "In California, wealthy patients are offering top dollar to cut the line for a Covid-19 vaccine - jacksonprogress-argus", "pubDate": "2020-12-19T08:45:20+00:00", "description": "While the nation continues to see record levels of new Covid-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths, wealthy patients in Southern California -- the epicenter of the state's Covid-19 crisis -- are", "imageUrl": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/jacksonprogress-argus.com/content/tncms/custom/image/e71f08c6-99cc-11e5-9445-27ee81b2c343.jpg", "language": "en", "country": "nz", "content": "Yes.

Generally, what happens is that she will reach out to the family to see what will work for everyone. We\u2019ll make any other plans around the agreed-upon plan. Then, closer to the holiday, my sister-in-law will change the plans saying that the new plans work better for her family. Most often the new plans conflict with other plans that we\u2019ve made.\n\nThis year she not only changed the day and time of our family get-together but also decided that it would be held at her house rather than ours.\n\nI don\u2019t want to miss seeing the rest of our family since we likely won\u2019t go to other holiday events that are being held indoors this year, but I feel like, if we keep accommodating her behavior, it will continue to happen. What\u2019s your take on it? -- Tired of Accommodating\n\nDear Tired of Accommodating: My take for this year is simple: Don\u2019t go to or host indoor gatherings with people outside of your household. As for next year and the years after that, if and when your sister-in-law attempts these last-minute changes, just say no -- politely, of course. You can keep it simple: Something like, \u201cWe\u2019d like to keep to the time and place that we all agreed to.\u201d It\u2019s reasonable to ask that everyone stick to the agreed-upon time and place, out of consideration for everyone\u2019s schedules. That\u2019s the whole point of plans, after all.\n\nDear Annie: My husband of decades has a habit that I don\u2019t care for, and I can\u2019t seem to make him understand the problem. I have run out of ideas, have asked counselors and anyone I can that might have an answer or suggestion. I am desperate to see whether you or your readers have any ideas.\n\nThe issue is this: If he sees anything around and he doesn\u2019t recognize it, he throws it away. If you are right there, then you can stop him. Otherwise, you\u2019re out of luck. I check the garbage for items regularly.\n\nThe last things he tossed out that I didn\u2019t catch were my two photo albums from my childhood. My mom, dad and great-grandma worked on those two albums. Needless to say, the albums contained pictures of many individuals who are gone. I can\u2019t seem to forgive him and get over it. It\u2019s mostly grieving for what I can never see ever again. I thought I\u2019d made him understand that these sentimental items are mine and that he has no right to throw something away without checking with me. Please help... I have tried counseling, both me alone and us together. I have left notes on items from matter-of-fact to rather nasty. I have tried explaining, every day, not to throw my things away. Please tell me how to deal with this problem. I am at my wit\u2019s end! -- Missing My Things\n\nDear Missing: While not considered its own psychological disorder, compulsive decluttering can be a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder.

Why do you think that is?\n\nI don\u2019t feel like this show ended. I feel like it\u2019s alive today, probably even more than it was back then. I really do.\n\nMcLeod\u2019s Daughters is bigger than us. It\u2019s bigger than you. It\u2019s bigger than me. It has a massive global following. And the wonderful thing that\u2019s happened through COVID has been this lifeline for not only people who are dedicated fans from the 2000s, but we have new fans coming on board all of the time. We have generations watching.\n\n[During this period] I started watching Outlander. It has got me through. I\u2019ve fallen in love with these characters. I had this moment when I was watching when I went, \u201cNow I get what people get with McLeod\u2019s.\u201d When a show is so beautifully made and the characters are so detailed and we can savour them, you really feel like they\u2019re a part of your heart and your family. Tess McLeod sits warmly in my heart. She always will; she\u2019s part of me.\n\nAnd apparently there\u2019s now a feature film being made?\n\n[Creator and showrunner] Posie Graeme-Evans is, at the moment, writing the feature script. If and when it comes back \u2013 of course, we know how hard things are to develop, but we\u2019ve all got our fingers and toes crossed \u2013 I can\u2019t imagine how profoundly intriguing it\u2019s going to be for me to revisit and step into Tess\u2019 shoes again.\n\nYou know, I always say [my son] Otis was on McLeod\u2019s. He was in my tummy \u2013 I was seven-and-a-half or eight months pregnant when I stopped, so he was on the show. And then I was back on set when he was four weeks old. I\u2019m a very hands-on mum, so he was on set every day. I was breastfeeding. It was chaos. So much has changed since then.\n\nNot only have I changed, but what\u2019s happened in Tess\u2019 life? It\u2019s a bit like you have multiple personalities, as an actor.\n\nSpeaking of multiple personalities, you\u2019ll be seen on Home And Away next year.\n\nBut you\u2019ve actually played two other characters on the show before [Toni Jarvis in 1995 and Brooke Taylor in 1999].\n\nYeah, it\u2019s amazing [laughs]. It\u2019s my third time and third character now. I knew I\u2019d been on Home And Away obviously, but it was such a long time ago and I was like, \u201cI don\u2019t even remember my character\u2019s name!\u201d\n\nI remembered one storyline because it was with Rachael Blake, who\u2019s a wonderful Australian actress. We were in NIDA together. I think the other one, it was back in the time of Nic Testoni and the beautiful Belinda Emmett [who passed away in 2006].\n\nIt was a very special time. It\u2019s a testament to the success and longevity of this wonderful Australian show called Home And Away.\n\nYour latest character on the show is Susie, who is a real-estate agent.\n\nSince Summer Bay is the most dangerous place to live in Australia, what with all the kidnappings, explosions and hostage situations, how hard is it for her to sell houses?\n\nShe\u2019s got a tough job! When I first started, the cast were like, \u201cOh, everything happens here. Murders, kidnapping\u2026 don\u2019t worry about it. This is just Summer Bay.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, OK. Thanks for the welcome.\u201d\n\nAudiences are so dedicated and committed that anything can happen. There\u2019s something really magical about that, I think. I fell off my chair when I received the phone call from my agent about Home And Away. It was in the middle of COVID and nothing was shooting.\n\nI said to my agent, \u201cWhat? How can this happen?\u201d I was so perplexed and astounded \u2013 and excited. And yes, Susie\u2019s a real-estate agent.\n\nI live in Byron Bay, so I\u2019m surrounded by real-estate agents [laughs]. It\u2019s crazy here at the moment. I\u2019m just so glad I\u2019m on my farm with nature and paddocks around me.

It\u2019s good for your soul, I think, to work. And it\u2019s also good for your soul to be told you have done a good job, whatever job you do.\u201d\n\nWeaver\u2019s first surprise Academy Award nomination, in 2011, for her steely, against-type performance as a suburban crime matriarch in Animal Kingdom, might have had a big impact on the kind of projects she was offered, but it didn\u2019t really alter her work habits.\n\nAfter wrapping principal photography on David Mich\u00f4d\u2019s underworld drama, the actress appeared in six plays across Australia \u2013 including a widely acclaimed production of Uncle Vanya starring Cate Blanchett, Richard Roxburgh and Hugo Weaving, and a regional tour of Steel Magnolias.\n\n\u201cCountry people knew I was working because they used to see me every few months in another play,\u201d says Weaver.\n\nWhether she\u2019s sparring on screen with Robert De Niro in Silver Linings Playbook or treading the boards opposite Michael Caton in a bare-bones theatrical production in an Australian country town, her criteria for taking a role are simple. First, she has to like the story. Beyond that? The character has to have some kind of a journey.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be Shakespeare,\u201d Weaver says in a Zoom interview from the freshly painted apartment she and her husband Sean Taylor recently bought in Los Angeles. A well-stocked bookcase warms the wall behind her.\n\n\u201cI mean, I\u2019d love just to do Tom Stoppard plays and only work with Martin Scorsese or Quentin Tarantino, but there are thousands of storytellers out there who have a decent story to tell.\u201d\n\nBesides, those two Oscar nominations (the other came for Silver Linings Playbook) mean something. Namely, she says with a laugh, \u201cThe second one proves the first one wasn\u2019t a fluke.\u201d\n\nBut the 73-year-old isn\u2019t convinced that those performances are even her best. \u201cI thought I did a good job [in Animal Kingdom] but I was pretty overwhelmed by the reaction it got,\u201d she admits. \u201cAnd I have also done some good things that didn\u2019t get so much attention.\u201d\n\nTaylor, for instance, believes his wife\u2019s work as Lee Harvey Oswald\u2019s mother in Parkland is one of her best. \u201cAnd that passed without much of a ripple,\u201d observes Weaver. \u201cYou go into everything thinking, \u2018This could be the best thing I\u2019ve ever done\u2019, even if you\u2019ve only got two or three scenes.\u201d\n\nWeaver doesn\u2019t have a lot of screen time in Penguin Bloom, an upcoming film based on the true story of an injured magpie that helped an Australian family overcome their grief, but she still makes an indelible impression.\n\nOne can sense the heartache and impotence that underpin her character\u2019s busybody behaviour as she hovers over her daughter, Sam (Naomi Watts), who has been paralysed from the chest down in a freak accident.\n\nWeaver met Watts briefly at the 2013 Oscars, where they were fellow nominees. \u201cI didn\u2019t really know Naomi apart from that and I hadn\u2019t worked with her before,\u201d she says. \u201cThat was the reason I wanted to do the film. I\u2019ve been a huge admirer of Naomi\u2019s ever since Mulholland Dr. It was great to observe her up close. She\u2019s terrific.\u201d\n\nDirector Glendyn Ivin\u2019s poignant adaptation of Cameron Bloom and Bradley Trevor Greive\u2019s bestselling book was one of the last films Weaver made before international borders were closed by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe inspirational drama was shot on location at the Blooms\u2019 real house, on a hill overlooking the ocean north of Sydney. \u201cFilming where we did brings home to you just how physically beautiful it is,\u201d says Weaver. \u201cIt\u2019s 100 miles of the most spectacular harbour and coastline. We tend to take that for granted.\u201d\n\nNot anymore. One of the few downsides to Weaver\u2019s late-career revival is the distance it puts between her and her family, including son Dylan, daughter-in-law Makiko, and her two grandchildren. \u201cI do miss them,\u201d the actor says. Still, the past eight months in virtual lockdown overseas have kept her busy with distractions.\n\nWhile the four projects Weaver had lined up prior to the pandemic have been shelved or postponed, she recently spent a month in Montana filming a guest role on the Kevin Costner TV series Yellowstone.\n\n\u201cIt was a strange experience because the coronavirus protocols were really strict. We were tested every day. We couldn\u2019t go anywhere. We wore masks. Nobody could go near anybody on set.\u201d\n\nAnd there\u2019s the matter of her new home. After a decade renting in West Hollywood, she and Taylor finally decided to put down some roots. \u201cIt\u2019s just a modest little flat, about 10 minutes from where we were living,\u201d she says. So there are plenty of moving boxes to finish unpacking and decorating to be done.\n\nShe has also been quietly developing a couple of projects of her own, even if she has no idea where they will go. \u201cHeaven knows when they are going to be able to be produced! I think we\u2019re stuck with this for quite a while.\u201d\n\nWeaver says lockdown confirmed her suspicions that she\u2019s a definite introvert. \u201cJust having my husband and my dog to talk to hasn\u2019t bothered me at all,\u201d she says. \u201cThe things I miss the most are intimate bars \u2013 I like a drink in a cosy bar \u2013 and the cinema.\u201d\n\nBefore the pandemic, she and Taylor went to the movies two or three times a week: \u201cYou only do justice to a filmmaker\u2019s vision if you see it in a proper cinema.\u201d But she hardly misses the attendant opening-night functions that come with the job.\n\nShe may be drawn to extroverts \u2013 \u201cThey are entertaining and bring out the best in people. I used to have a lovely time being with Derryn [Hinch, to whom she was \u201chappily married\u201d for 12 years], because I didn\u2019t have to say much at all. I could just observe and listen\u201d \u2013 but trying to force conversation with them in that environment can be a punish.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like parties. I find them difficult \u2013 talking to strangers about meaningless things. My husband and I usually find a corner and sit there... talking to each other.\u201d\n\nWhy Claudia Karvan stripped down to her underwear\n\nMelissa Tkautz: \u2018Simon Baker was my first real love\u2019", "topic": "entertainment", "tag": "headline", "types": [], "claim": "", "verdict": ""}, {"url": "https://www.geo.tv/latest/324957-coronavirus-and-vitamin-d-is-there-hope-for-immunity-with-the-supplement", "source": "geo.tv", "authors": ["Web Desk"], "title": "Coronavirus and Vitamin D: Is there hope for immunity with the supplement? - Geo News", "pubDate": "2020-12-17T14:59:01+00:00", "description": "Experts say it is important to take Vitamin D this winter as a lot of time will be spent indoors staying safe from coronavirus", "imageUrl": "https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-17/324957_081950_updates.jpg", "language": "en", "country": "gb", "content": "An expert panel has said that there is not enough evidence that Vitamin D supplements are effective against protecting people from COVID-19, BBC reported on Thursday.\n\nThe panel consists of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, Public Health England and the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition.\n\nIt said that people, however, should continue to take the supplement \"to keep bones and muscles healthy\".\n\nA review of a possible link between Vitamin D and COVID-19 was carried out after a few studies suggested the vitamin \"might play a role in the boy's immune response to respiratory viruses\", the British publication said.\n\nThe panel, however, concluded that there was \"insufficient evidence\" to recommend it as a treatment or for prevention.\n\nDr Paul Chrisp, director of the centre for guidelines at NICE, said: \"We are continuing to monitor evidence as it is published and will review and update the guidance if necessary.\"\n\nProf Adrian Martineau, clinical professor of respiratory infection and immunity at Queen Mary University of London, said there was a chance the vitamin \"might reduce risk and/or severity of Covid-19\" and clinical trials currently in progress would \"hopefully shed light on this question\".\n\nAccording to BBC, it is more than important than ever to take Vitamin D this winter as a lot of time will be spent indoors isolating and staying safe from coronavirus.\n\nThe sunlight, otherwise, is a key source.\n\nVitamin D is also found in oily fish and cereals.\n\nThe following people are said by BBC to be \"at risk\" of having low levels of Vitamin D even in summer and spring:\n\u2022 those with dark skin (such as people with African, African-Caribbean or south Asian backgrounds)\n\u2022 those who don't go outside often\n\u2022 those who cover up most of their skin when outdoors\n\nThese people are advised to ensure an all year long consumption of a Vitamin D supplement.\n\nDr Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at Public Health England, said: \"We advise that everyone \u2014 particularly the elderly, those who don't get outside and those with dark skin \u2014 takes a vitamin D supplement containing 10 micrograms (400IU) every day,\" she said.\n\n\"This year, the advice is more important than ever with more people spending more time inside.\"", "topic": "health", "tag": "headline", "types": [], "claim": "", "verdict": ""}, {"url": "https://www.ctvnews.ca/business/canadian-pacific-to-pilot-hydrogen-powered-train-to-decarbonize-freight-transport-1.5237363", "source": "ctvnews.ca", "authors": [], "title": "Canadian Pacific to pilot hydrogen-powered train to decarbonize freight transport - CTV News", "pubDate": "2020-12-18T16:58:00+00:00", "description": "Canadian Pacific says it will pilot a new project to build a hydrogen-powered train.

Why do you think that is?\n\nI don\u2019t feel like this show ended. I feel like it\u2019s alive today, probably even more than it was back then. I really do.\n\nMcLeod\u2019s Daughters is bigger than us. It\u2019s bigger than you. It\u2019s bigger than me. It has a massive global following. And the wonderful thing that\u2019s happened through COVID has been this lifeline for not only people who are dedicated fans from the 2000s, but we have new fans coming on board all of the time. We have generations watching.\n\n[During this period] I started watching Outlander. It has got me through. I\u2019ve fallen in love with these characters. I had this moment when I was watching when I went, \u201cNow I get what people get with McLeod\u2019s.\u201d When a show is so beautifully made and the characters are so detailed and we can savour them, you really feel like they\u2019re a part of your heart and your family. Tess McLeod sits warmly in my heart. She always will; she\u2019s part of me.\n\nAnd apparently there\u2019s now a feature film being made?\n\n[Creator and showrunner] Posie Graeme-Evans is, at the moment, writing the feature script. If and when it comes back \u2013 of course, we know how hard things are to develop, but we\u2019ve all got our fingers and toes crossed \u2013 I can\u2019t imagine how profoundly intriguing it\u2019s going to be for me to revisit and step into Tess\u2019 shoes again.\n\nYou know, I always say [my son] Otis was on McLeod\u2019s. He was in my tummy \u2013 I was seven-and-a-half or eight months pregnant when I stopped, so he was on the show. And then I was back on set when he was four weeks old. I\u2019m a very hands-on mum, so he was on set every day. I was breastfeeding. It was chaos. So much has changed since then.\n\nNot only have I changed, but what\u2019s happened in Tess\u2019 life? It\u2019s a bit like you have multiple personalities, as an actor.\n\nSpeaking of multiple personalities, you\u2019ll be seen on Home And Away next year.\n\nBut you\u2019ve actually played two other characters on the show before [Toni Jarvis in 1995 and Brooke Taylor in 1999].\n\nYeah, it\u2019s amazing [laughs]. It\u2019s my third time and third character now. I knew I\u2019d been on Home And Away obviously, but it was such a long time ago and I was like, \u201cI don\u2019t even remember my character\u2019s name!\u201d\n\nI remembered one storyline because it was with Rachael Blake, who\u2019s a wonderful Australian actress. We were in NIDA together. I think the other one, it was back in the time of Nic Testoni and the beautiful Belinda Emmett [who passed away in 2006].\n\nIt was a very special time. It\u2019s a testament to the success and longevity of this wonderful Australian show called Home And Away.\n\nYour latest character on the show is Susie, who is a real-estate agent.\n\nSince Summer Bay is the most dangerous place to live in Australia, what with all the kidnappings, explosions and hostage situations, how hard is it for her to sell houses?\n\nShe\u2019s got a tough job! When I first started, the cast were like, \u201cOh, everything happens here. Murders, kidnapping\u2026 don\u2019t worry about it. This is just Summer Bay.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, OK. Thanks for the welcome.\u201d\n\nAudiences are so dedicated and committed that anything can happen. There\u2019s something really magical about that, I think. I fell off my chair when I received the phone call from my agent about Home And Away. It was in the middle of COVID and nothing was shooting.\n\nI said to my agent, \u201cWhat? How can this happen?\u201d I was so perplexed and astounded \u2013 and excited. And yes, Susie\u2019s a real-estate agent.\n\nI live in Byron Bay, so I\u2019m surrounded by real-estate agents [laughs]. It\u2019s crazy here at the moment. I\u2019m just so glad I\u2019m on my farm with nature and paddocks around me. And cows!\n\nIt certainly seems like Byron Bay is the place to be\u2026 [Carter lives there with her husband, clothing designer Michael Wilson, and sons Otis, 15, and Tobias, 10].\n\nI live on my farm and it\u2019s a very simple life. I talk to the women in the supermarket who I\u2019ve known for 20 years.\n\nI want to hear about how their day is going, I want to hear if they\u2019re recovering from their chemotherapy, I want to hear if their mum bought that couch or not.

It\u2019s good for your soul, I think, to work. And it\u2019s also good for your soul to be told you have done a good job, whatever job you do.\u201d\n\nWeaver\u2019s first surprise Academy Award nomination, in 2011, for her steely, against-type performance as a suburban crime matriarch in Animal Kingdom, might have had a big impact on the kind of projects she was offered, but it didn\u2019t really alter her work habits.\n\nAfter wrapping principal photography on David Mich\u00f4d\u2019s underworld drama, the actress appeared in six plays across Australia \u2013 including a widely acclaimed production of Uncle Vanya starring Cate Blanchett, Richard Roxburgh and Hugo Weaving, and a regional tour of Steel Magnolias.\n\n\u201cCountry people knew I was working because they used to see me every few months in another play,\u201d says Weaver.\n\nWhether she\u2019s sparring on screen with Robert De Niro in Silver Linings Playbook or treading the boards opposite Michael Caton in a bare-bones theatrical production in an Australian country town, her criteria for taking a role are simple. First, she has to like the story. Beyond that? The character has to have some kind of a journey.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be Shakespeare,\u201d Weaver says in a Zoom interview from the freshly painted apartment she and her husband Sean Taylor recently bought in Los Angeles. A well-stocked bookcase warms the wall behind her.\n\n\u201cI mean, I\u2019d love just to do Tom Stoppard plays and only work with Martin Scorsese or Quentin Tarantino, but there are thousands of storytellers out there who have a decent story to tell.\u201d\n\nBesides, those two Oscar nominations (the other came for Silver Linings Playbook) mean something. Namely, she says with a laugh, \u201cThe second one proves the first one wasn\u2019t a fluke.\u201d\n\nBut the 73-year-old isn\u2019t convinced that those performances are even her best. \u201cI thought I did a good job [in Animal Kingdom] but I was pretty overwhelmed by the reaction it got,\u201d she admits. \u201cAnd I have also done some good things that didn\u2019t get so much attention.\u201d\n\nTaylor, for instance, believes his wife\u2019s work as Lee Harvey Oswald\u2019s mother in Parkland is one of her best. \u201cAnd that passed without much of a ripple,\u201d observes Weaver. \u201cYou go into everything thinking, \u2018This could be the best thing I\u2019ve ever done\u2019, even if you\u2019ve only got two or three scenes.\u201d\n\nWeaver doesn\u2019t have a lot of screen time in Penguin Bloom, an upcoming film based on the true story of an injured magpie that helped an Australian family overcome their grief, but she still makes an indelible impression.\n\nOne can sense the heartache and impotence that underpin her character\u2019s busybody behaviour as she hovers over her daughter, Sam (Naomi Watts), who has been paralysed from the chest down in a freak accident.\n\nWeaver met Watts briefly at the 2013 Oscars, where they were fellow nominees. \u201cI didn\u2019t really know Naomi apart from that and I hadn\u2019t worked with her before,\u201d she says. \u201cThat was the reason I wanted to do the film. I\u2019ve been a huge admirer of Naomi\u2019s ever since Mulholland Dr. It was great to observe her up close. She\u2019s terrific.\u201d\n\nDirector Glendyn Ivin\u2019s poignant adaptation of Cameron Bloom and Bradley Trevor Greive\u2019s bestselling book was one of the last films Weaver made before international borders were closed by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe inspirational drama was shot on location at the Blooms\u2019 real house, on a hill overlooking the ocean north of Sydney. \u201cFilming where we did brings home to you just how physically beautiful it is,\u201d says Weaver. \u201cIt\u2019s 100 miles of the most spectacular harbour and coastline. We tend to take that for granted.\u201d\n\nNot anymore. One of the few downsides to Weaver\u2019s late-career revival is the distance it puts between her and her family, including son Dylan, daughter-in-law Makiko, and her two grandchildren. \u201cI do miss them,\u201d the actor says. Still, the past eight months in virtual lockdown overseas have kept her busy with distractions.\n\nWhile the four projects Weaver had lined up prior to the pandemic have been shelved or postponed, she recently spent a month in Montana filming a guest role on the Kevin Costner TV series Yellowstone.\n\n\u201cIt was a strange experience because the coronavirus protocols were really strict. We were tested every day. We couldn\u2019t go anywhere. We wore masks. Nobody could go near anybody on set.\u201d\n\nAnd there\u2019s the matter of her new home. After a decade renting in West Hollywood, she and Taylor finally decided to put down some roots. \u201cIt\u2019s just a modest little flat, about 10 minutes from where we were living,\u201d she says. So there are plenty of moving boxes to finish unpacking and decorating to be done.\n\nShe has also been quietly developing a couple of projects of her own, even if she has no idea where they will go. \u201cHeaven knows when they are going to be able to be produced! I think we\u2019re stuck with this for quite a while.\u201d\n\nWeaver says lockdown confirmed her suspicions that she\u2019s a definite introvert. \u201cJust having my husband and my dog to talk to hasn\u2019t bothered me at all,\u201d she says. \u201cThe things I miss the most are intimate bars \u2013 I like a drink in a cosy bar \u2013 and the cinema.\u201d\n\nBefore the pandemic, she and Taylor went to the movies two or three times a week: \u201cYou only do justice to a filmmaker\u2019s vision if you see it in a proper cinema.\u201d But she hardly misses the attendant opening-night functions that come with the job.\n\nShe may be drawn to extroverts \u2013 \u201cThey are entertaining and bring out the best in people. I used to have a lovely time being with Derryn [Hinch, to whom she was \u201chappily married\u201d for 12 years], because I didn\u2019t have to say much at all. I could just observe and listen\u201d \u2013 but trying to force conversation with them in that environment can be a punish.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like parties. I find them difficult \u2013 talking to strangers about meaningless things. My husband and I usually find a corner and sit there... talking to each other.\u201d\n\nWhy Claudia Karvan stripped down to her underwear\n\nMelissa Tkautz: \u2018Simon Baker was my first real love\u2019", "topic": "entertainment", "tag": "headline", "types": [], "claim": "", "verdict": ""}, {"url": "https://www.ctvnews.ca/business/canadian-pacific-to-pilot-hydrogen-powered-train-to-decarbonize-freight-transport-1.5237363", "source": "ctvnews.ca", "authors": [], "title": "Canadian Pacific to pilot hydrogen-powered train to decarbonize freight transport - CTV News", "pubDate": "2020-12-18T16:58:00+00:00", "description": "Canadian Pacific says it will pilot a new project to build a hydrogen-powered train.

But as distribution of the vaccines begin, online accounts are exploiting loopholes in new policies and successfully sharing misleading claims that attempt to discourage vaccination.\n\nThroughout the pandemic, platforms have established and updated rules meant to curb false claims related to Covid-19. Between March and October, Facebook took down 12 million pieces of content on Facebook and Instagram, and it added fact-checking labels to another 167 million posts. But the rollout of an authorized Covid-19 vaccine has forced social media companies to adapt again, changing their approach to both Covid-19 misinformation and longstanding anti-vaccination content.\n\nThere are already plenty of examples of online content that sow doubt in Covid-19 vaccines. Posts that suggest vaccination is part of a government scheme and memes that imply that the vaccine comes with extreme side effects either aren\u2019t being caught by the platforms or don\u2019t appear to violate their rules.\n\nThe platforms aren\u2019t just contending with anti-vaccination communities. Conspiracy theorists, conservative groups, fringe outlets, and others are actively hyping concerns about vaccines, according to Yonder, a firm that\u2019s advising companies involved in vaccine development. While recent polls indicate the number of Americans willing to get the vaccine has grown \u2014 to about 70 percent, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation \u2014 millions of Americans are still reluctant to take the vaccine, and many may not take it immediately.\n\nFacebook has vowed to remove false Covid-19 vaccine claims that could cause imminent physical harm, and YouTube has said it will take down videos about Covid-19 vaccines that contradict health authorities like the World Health Organization. Twitter is taking the two-pronged approach of taking down Covid-19 misinformation it deems the most harmful, plus labeling claims that are merely misleading.\n\nBut overall, these approaches thus far seem focused on removing misinformation rather than addressing the broader scope of vaccine hesitancy and skepticism \u2014 a hurdle that could be much more complicated to address.\n\nWhile platforms tend to tout new policies designed to curb misinformation, they don\u2019t always find and remove all the content that violates their rules. In searching Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter, Recode found plenty of vaccine misinformation that had yet to be removed or labeled as such.\n\nOn Facebook, Recode identified several posts that were only taken down after we flagged them. Some of those removed claim the pandemic was planned, or that the vaccine would include a microchip, a claim that\u2019s specifically banned under Facebook\u2019s rules. Another post that was taken down by Facebook was a meme that jokingly implied that the vaccine comes with extreme side effects. The image had already been shared more than 100,000 times by the time Facebook took it down.\n\nOther posts identified by Recode that appeared to violate the company\u2019s rules include one Facebook post claiming that the Covid-19 vaccine will \u201calter your DNA\u201d and \u201cattack the uterus.\u201d It linked to a YouTube video that references the \u201cPlandemic\u201d conspiracy theory and Bill Gates. The post had been shared in a Facebook group with more than 12,000 members, and the video was viewed more than 15,000 times on YouTube. Similarly, in a public Facebook group with 50,000 members, a post alleged that the Covid-19 vaccines were part of an attempt to \u201ckeep us from ascending into the spiritual beings that we were meant to be.\u201d\n\nWhile YouTube has promised to remove Covid-19 vaccine misinformation, Recode found a range of content on the platform that seemed to violate those policies, including easily discovered videos suggesting that the Covid-19 vaccine changes a person\u2019s DNA or that the vaccine is a ploy to intentionally kill the elderly in nursing homes. YouTube took down one video flagged by Recode that suggested the vaccine could be the \u201cmark of the Beast\u201d and connected it to the end times in the Christian New Testament\u2019s book Revelation.\n\nMedia Matters has found that, despite YouTube\u2019s policies, videos suggesting that the Covid-19 vaccine included a microchip have received more than 400,000 views, and some of them had ads running on them. Meanwhile, Sam Clark, at the YouTube watchdog site Transparency Tube, points out that plenty of channels known for pushing conspiracies are posting about vaccines.\n\nTwitter will begin enforcing its new policies against Covid-19 misinformation starting on December 21, and research shows that the problem is significant and growing. November saw the greatest increase in the number of retweets of vaccine misinformation on Twitter this year, according to the misinformation-tracking company VineSight.\n\nIndividual posts on these platforms don\u2019t necessarily gain a lot of engagement, but they can get a significant amount of traction in aggregate and can even spread to other platforms. According to data from Zignal Labs, between December 8 and 14, there were nearly 30,000 mentions of the claim that the Chinese Communist Party had ties to the vaccines and nearly 90,000 mentions of Bell\u2019s palsy, an often temporary condition that causes parts of one\u2019s face to sag. After four participants in the Moderna vaccine trial got the condition, the FDA warned people to watch for signs of Bell\u2019s palsy, but the agency says there\u2019s not enough information to link Bell\u2019s palsy and the vaccine.\n\nMeanwhile, much of the content sowing doubt about Covid-19 vaccines avoids making factual claims and doesn\u2019t get removed. In an Instagram post, for instance, conservative commentator Candace Owens called people who get the vaccine \u201csheep.\u201d The video was given a label by Facebook, but it was still viewed more than 2 million times.\n\nAlso fueling anxiety are those making false claims about mandatory vaccinations, which the US government is not considering. Research from Zignal Labs found that, between December 8 and 14, there were more than 40,000 mentions of a mandatory vaccine on the platforms it tracks.\n\n\u201cFactually, they\u2019re fighting a ghost. They\u2019re fighting a boogeyman,\u201d notes David Broniatowski, who studies behavioral epidemiology at George Washington University. \u201cThere is nobody out there who\u2019s saying that we\u2019re going to pass a law mandating a Covid vaccine.\u201d\n\nThese ideas don\u2019t exactly amount to misinformation, and they often stop short of making claims about the vaccine itself. Still, they serve to undermine confidence in vaccination by raising the prospect of government control, politicizing the vaccine, or raising doubts about the science behind it.\n\n\u201cSomebody says, \u2018Do you know what\u2019s in the Covid vaccine?\u2019 And they just leave it at that \u2014it\u2019s not really misinformation,\u201d said Broniatowski. \u201cBut it\u2019s certainly increasing distrust in the vaccine.\u201d\n\nThis ambiguity makes the job of moderating what\u2019s allowed on sites like Facebook and YouTube very difficult. These platforms don\u2019t want to be accused of amplifying anti-vaccination content, but responsibly sorting through content that includes Covid-19 vaccine-oriented debates, humor, opinions, and facts as well as misinformation is a major endeavor, especially because we\u2019re still learning more about Covid-19 vaccines. At the same time, public health experts have also emphasized that people ought to have space to ask questions about vaccines.\n\nImportantly, these platforms are using strategies beyond take-downs, like applying labels and elevating accurate information from health authorities. But the primary concern is that the policies of Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube could ultimately exacerbate the problem of vaccine hesitancy, not only through policing misinformation but also dealing with those gray areas. So while the public might pressure platforms to take down objectionable content, what they leave up is just as tricky.\n\nOpen Sourced is made possible by Omidyar Network.

As an actor, I'm familiar with those kind of questions, because, for example, with working in the Jurassic franchise, it's like, 'OK, we can have fun with some deep cuts for the fans, but, at the end of the day, it's about a good story, well told.\n\n\"'What is that balance? How might something that has been established in The Lost World or whatnot play a factor into the storytelling for Jurassic World: Dominion?'\"\n\n\n\n\"By the way, that's not a spoiler. I'm just making that up randomly right now!\" she added, laughing.\n\nHoward added that she feels that the existence of a \"larger world\" while telling a story can be \"a real asset\", because it provides added depth and richness to events and characters.\n\n\"If you're telling a story that is a biopic or something, and there's a bunch of characters that are smaller characters in that biopic, but you can go, and you can read about all of them, because they existed, and their lives are well-documented and whatnot, it's only going to better inform the biopic that's centring on the one character.\n\n\"Because you will have these fully fleshed out other characters that, even though it's not centralising on them, they're a part of the narrative.\"\n\nAs for The Mandalorian, Howard revealed that she is very aware of the need to appeal to both casual viewers and more devoted Star Wars fans, saying that \"plate-spinning\" is needed to provide a great viewing experience to both.\n\n\"I would liken that as well to The Mandalorian in that there are these stories of characters that exist, but even though they might not be playing a central role... Constantly in stories, there are new characters. But in this one, what's cool is, (if you are a super-fan), you will actually be caught up, and will have an understanding of the various layers of the scene,\" she said.\n\nRelated: The Mandalorian finale just changed the show forever\n\n\"But the scene needs to work for someone who's five years old and hasn't seen anything else. Again, that's the plate-spinning job of the series.\"\n\nShe added that she feels the involvement of executive producer Dave Filoni, who has worked on a number of Star Wars series, means that Star Wars fans expect \"richer\" storytelling and that the team try to incorporate this while keeping the action enjoyable for fans who are new to some established characters.\n\n\"I think to not connect The Mandalorian in any shape or form, especially with Dave Filoni's collaboration, it would personally feel like a missed opportunity,\" she said. \"As a fan, when I see Dave's name on something, I want the storytelling to be that much richer.\n\n\"I want to feel the specificity of the Star Wars universe be brought to life, especially when it's live-action. It's definitely a fine line. But that's part of the joy.\"\n\nThe Mandalorian season 1 and season 2 are streaming now on Disney+.\n\nStar Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and the entire Skywalker Saga are available on DVD, Blu-ray and 4K now, as well as on Disney+, while Rise of Skywalker is also on Sky Cinema Premiere and NOW TV.\n\nDigital Spy has launched its first-ever digital magazine with exclusive features, interviews, and videos.

Why do you think that is?\n\nI don\u2019t feel like this show ended. I feel like it\u2019s alive today, probably even more than it was back then. I really do.\n\nMcLeod\u2019s Daughters is bigger than us. It\u2019s bigger than you. It\u2019s bigger than me. It has a massive global following. And the wonderful thing that\u2019s happened through COVID has been this lifeline for not only people who are dedicated fans from the 2000s, but we have new fans coming on board all of the time. We have generations watching.\n\n[During this period] I started watching Outlander. It has got me through. I\u2019ve fallen in love with these characters. I had this moment when I was watching when I went, \u201cNow I get what people get with McLeod\u2019s.\u201d When a show is so beautifully made and the characters are so detailed and we can savour them, you really feel like they\u2019re a part of your heart and your family. Tess McLeod sits warmly in my heart. She always will; she\u2019s part of me.\n\nAnd apparently there\u2019s now a feature film being made?\n\n[Creator and showrunner] Posie Graeme-Evans is, at the moment, writing the feature script. If and when it comes back \u2013 of course, we know how hard things are to develop, but we\u2019ve all got our fingers and toes crossed \u2013 I can\u2019t imagine how profoundly intriguing it\u2019s going to be for me to revisit and step into Tess\u2019 shoes again.\n\nYou know, I always say [my son] Otis was on McLeod\u2019s. He was in my tummy \u2013 I was seven-and-a-half or eight months pregnant when I stopped, so he was on the show. And then I was back on set when he was four weeks old. I\u2019m a very hands-on mum, so he was on set every day. I was breastfeeding. It was chaos. So much has changed since then.\n\nNot only have I changed, but what\u2019s happened in Tess\u2019 life? It\u2019s a bit like you have multiple personalities, as an actor.\n\nSpeaking of multiple personalities, you\u2019ll be seen on Home And Away next year.\n\nBut you\u2019ve actually played two other characters on the show before [Toni Jarvis in 1995 and Brooke Taylor in 1999].\n\nYeah, it\u2019s amazing [laughs]. It\u2019s my third time and third character now. I knew I\u2019d been on Home And Away obviously, but it was such a long time ago and I was like, \u201cI don\u2019t even remember my character\u2019s name!\u201d\n\nI remembered one storyline because it was with Rachael Blake, who\u2019s a wonderful Australian actress. We were in NIDA together. I think the other one, it was back in the time of Nic Testoni and the beautiful Belinda Emmett [who passed away in 2006].\n\nIt was a very special time. It\u2019s a testament to the success and longevity of this wonderful Australian show called Home And Away.\n\nYour latest character on the show is Susie, who is a real-estate agent.\n\nSince Summer Bay is the most dangerous place to live in Australia, what with all the kidnappings, explosions and hostage situations, how hard is it for her to sell houses?\n\nShe\u2019s got a tough job! When I first started, the cast were like, \u201cOh, everything happens here. Murders, kidnapping\u2026 don\u2019t worry about it. This is just Summer Bay.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, OK. Thanks for the welcome.\u201d\n\nAudiences are so dedicated and committed that anything can happen. There\u2019s something really magical about that, I think. I fell off my chair when I received the phone call from my agent about Home And Away. It was in the middle of COVID and nothing was shooting.\n\nI said to my agent, \u201cWhat? How can this happen?\u201d I was so perplexed and astounded \u2013 and excited. And yes, Susie\u2019s a real-estate agent.\n\nI live in Byron Bay, so I\u2019m surrounded by real-estate agents [laughs]. It\u2019s crazy here at the moment. I\u2019m just so glad I\u2019m on my farm with nature and paddocks around me. And cows!\n\nIt certainly seems like Byron Bay is the place to be\u2026 [Carter lives there with her husband, clothing designer Michael Wilson, and sons Otis, 15, and Tobias, 10].\n\nI live on my farm and it\u2019s a very simple life. I talk to the women in the supermarket who I\u2019ve known for 20 years.\n\nI want to hear about how their day is going, I want to hear if they\u2019re recovering from their chemotherapy, I want to hear if their mum bought that couch or not. I want to hear about their lives because that\u2019s what connects me to my community, it\u2019s what makes me feel like I belong. And then I know I\u2019m alright and that I have a place in the world.\n\nI\u2019m not interested in surface stuff and shallowness. What interests me is other people.\n\nHome and Away returns to the Seven Network and 7plus in February 2021.\n\nWhy Claudia Karvan stripped down to her underwear\n\nMelissa Tkautz: \u2018Simon Baker was my first real love\u2019", "topic": "entertainment", "tag": "headline", "types": [], "claim": "", "verdict": ""}, {"url": "https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/lifestyle/stellar/jacki-weaver-on-acting-penguin-bloom-and-those-anjelica-huston-comments/news-story/d5cb157fb7d3b95678d5bc744c94d984?nk=2d8d6fc6fdc105af9f33b703218393d6-1608486215", "source": "dailytelegraph.com.au", "authors": ["Vicky Roach"], "title": "The subject Jacki Weaver doesn\u2019t want to touch - Daily Telegraph", "pubDate": "2020-12-19T03:41:02+00:00", "description": "We&#039;re for Sydney", "imageUrl": "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/f137397899eaf32135200a5f8a231c32", "language": "en", "country": "au", "content": "The legendary Australian actor reveals why she refuses to shun roles, Oscar-worthy or not, and has no plans to stay quiet when provoked - just ask Anjelica Huston.\n\nThe subject of Jacki Weaver\u2019s very public stoush with Anjelica Huston has reared its ugly head \u2013 again.\n\nLast year, Huston slammed Weaver\u2019s comedy film Poms as an \u201cold-lady cheerleader movie\u201d, and in response, Weaver forthrightly retorted: \u201cShe can just go f*ck herself.\u201d\n\nToday, there are no curse words from Weaver when it comes up in her conversation with Stellar, just a sigh.\n\nShe would clearly like to move on from the controversy (and headlines) their back-and-forth generated, but the fact remains that Huston\u2019s provocative comments \u2013 a response to a journalist\u2019s question about why she didn\u2019t work much anymore \u2013 ended up being extraordinarily revealing.\n\nWhile Huston sits around waiting for what she dubbed a \u201cspecial old lady\u201d role worthy of her talent, Weaver prefers to keep practising her craft. \u201cWork is noble,\u201d the 73-year-old actor tells Stellar.\n\n\u201cI mean, it doesn\u2019t matter what you do \u2013 whether you\u2019re a railway fitter or a house painter. It\u2019s good for your soul, I think, to work. And it\u2019s also good for your soul to be told you have done a good job, whatever job you do.\u201d\n\nWeaver\u2019s first surprise Academy Award nomination, in 2011, for her steely, against-type performance as a suburban crime matriarch in Animal Kingdom, might have had a big impact on the kind of projects she was offered, but it didn\u2019t really alter her work habits.\n\nAfter wrapping principal photography on David Mich\u00f4d\u2019s underworld drama, the actress appeared in six plays across Australia \u2013 including a widely acclaimed production of Uncle Vanya starring Cate Blanchett, Richard Roxburgh and Hugo Weaving, and a regional tour of Steel Magnolias.\n\n\u201cCountry people knew I was working because they used to see me every few months in another play,\u201d says Weaver.\n\nWhether she\u2019s sparring on screen with Robert De Niro in Silver Linings Playbook or treading the boards opposite Michael Caton in a bare-bones theatrical production in an Australian country town, her criteria for taking a role are simple. First, she has to like the story. Beyond that? The character has to have some kind of a journey.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be Shakespeare,\u201d Weaver says in a Zoom interview from the freshly painted apartment she and her husband Sean Taylor recently bought in Los Angeles. A well-stocked bookcase warms the wall behind her.\n\n\u201cI mean, I\u2019d love just to do Tom Stoppard plays and only work with Martin Scorsese or Quentin Tarantino, but there are thousands of storytellers out there who have a decent story to tell.\u201d\n\nBesides, those two Oscar nominations (the other came for Silver Linings Playbook) mean something. Namely, she says with a laugh, \u201cThe second one proves the first one wasn\u2019t a fluke.\u201d\n\nBut the 73-year-old isn\u2019t convinced that those performances are even her best. \u201cI thought I did a good job [in Animal Kingdom] but I was pretty overwhelmed by the reaction it got,\u201d she admits. \u201cAnd I have also done some good things that didn\u2019t get so much attention.\u201d\n\nTaylor, for instance, believes his wife\u2019s work as Lee Harvey Oswald\u2019s mother in Parkland is one of her best. \u201cAnd that passed without much of a ripple,\u201d observes Weaver. \u201cYou go into everything thinking, \u2018This could be the best thing I\u2019ve ever done\u2019, even if you\u2019ve only got two or three scenes.\u201d\n\nWeaver doesn\u2019t have a lot of screen time in Penguin Bloom, an upcoming film based on the true story of an injured magpie that helped an Australian family overcome their grief, but she still makes an indelible impression.\n\nOne can sense the heartache and impotence that underpin her character\u2019s busybody behaviour as she hovers over her daughter, Sam (Naomi Watts), who has been paralysed from the chest down in a freak accident.\n\nWeaver met Watts briefly at the 2013 Oscars, where they were fellow nominees. \u201cI didn\u2019t really know Naomi apart from that and I hadn\u2019t worked with her before,\u201d she says. \u201cThat was the reason I wanted to do the film. I\u2019ve been a huge admirer of Naomi\u2019s ever since Mulholland Dr. It was great to observe her up close. She\u2019s terrific.\u201d\n\nDirector Glendyn Ivin\u2019s poignant adaptation of Cameron Bloom and Bradley Trevor Greive\u2019s bestselling book was one of the last films Weaver made before international borders were closed by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe inspirational drama was shot on location at the Blooms\u2019 real house, on a hill overlooking the ocean north of Sydney. \u201cFilming where we did brings home to you just how physically beautiful it is,\u201d says Weaver. \u201cIt\u2019s 100 miles of the most spectacular harbour and coastline. We tend to take that for granted.\u201d\n\nNot anymore. One of the few downsides to Weaver\u2019s late-career revival is the distance it puts between her and her family, including son Dylan, daughter-in-law Makiko, and her two grandchildren. \u201cI do miss them,\u201d the actor says. Still, the past eight months in virtual lockdown overseas have kept her busy with distractions.\n\nWhile the four projects Weaver had lined up prior to the pandemic have been shelved or postponed, she recently spent a month in Montana filming a guest role on the Kevin Costner TV series Yellowstone.\n\n\u201cIt was a strange experience because the coronavirus protocols were really strict. We were tested every day. We couldn\u2019t go anywhere. We wore masks. Nobody could go near anybody on set.\u201d\n\nAnd there\u2019s the matter of her new home. After a decade renting in West Hollywood, she and Taylor finally decided to put down some roots. \u201cIt\u2019s just a modest little flat, about 10 minutes from where we were living,\u201d she says. So there are plenty of moving boxes to finish unpacking and decorating to be done.\n\nShe has also been quietly developing a couple of projects of her own, even if she has no idea where they will go. \u201cHeaven knows when they are going to be able to be produced! I think we\u2019re stuck with this for quite a while.\u201d\n\nWeaver says lockdown confirmed her suspicions that she\u2019s a definite introvert. \u201cJust having my husband and my dog to talk to hasn\u2019t bothered me at all,\u201d she says. \u201cThe things I miss the most are intimate bars \u2013 I like a drink in a cosy bar \u2013 and the cinema.\u201d\n\nBefore the pandemic, she and Taylor went to the movies two or three times a week: \u201cYou only do justice to a filmmaker\u2019s vision if you see it in a proper cinema.\u201d But she hardly misses the attendant opening-night functions that come with the job.\n\nShe may be drawn to extroverts \u2013 \u201cThey are entertaining and bring out the best in people. I used to have a lovely time being with Derryn [Hinch, to whom she was \u201chappily married\u201d for 12 years], because I didn\u2019t have to say much at all. I could just observe and listen\u201d \u2013 but trying to force conversation with them in that environment can be a punish.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like parties. I find them difficult \u2013 talking to strangers about meaningless things. My husband and I usually find a corner and sit there... talking to each other.\u201d\n\nWhy Claudia Karvan stripped down to her underwear\n\nMelissa Tkautz: \u2018Simon Baker was my first real love\u2019", "topic": "entertainment", "tag": "headline", "types": [], "claim": "", "verdict": ""}, {"url": "https://www.geo.tv/latest/324957-coronavirus-and-vitamin-d-is-there-hope-for-immunity-with-the-supplement", "source": "geo.tv", "authors": ["Web Desk"], "title": "Coronavirus and Vitamin D: Is there hope for immunity with the supplement? - Geo News", "pubDate": "2020-12-17T14:59:01+00:00", "description": "Experts say it is important to take Vitamin D this winter as a lot of time will be spent indoors staying safe from coronavirus", "imageUrl": "https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2020-12-17/324957_081950_updates.jpg", "language": "en", "country": "gb", "content": "An expert panel has said that there is not enough evidence that Vitamin D supplements are effective against protecting people from COVID-19, BBC reported on Thursday.\n\nThe panel consists of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, Public Health England and the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition.\n\nIt said that people, however, should continue to take the supplement \"to keep bones and muscles healthy\".\n\nA review of a possible link between Vitamin D and COVID-19 was carried out after a few studies suggested the vitamin \"might play a role in the boy's immune response to respiratory viruses\", the British publication said.\n\nThe panel, however, concluded that there was \"insufficient evidence\" to recommend it as a treatment or for prevention.\n\nDr Paul Chrisp, director of the centre for guidelines at NICE, said: \"We are continuing to monitor evidence as it is published and will review and update the guidance if necessary.\"\n\nProf Adrian Martineau, clinical professor of respiratory infection and immunity at Queen Mary University of London, said there was a chance the vitamin \"might reduce risk and/or severity of Covid-19\" and clinical trials currently in progress would \"hopefully shed light on this question\".\n\nAccording to BBC, it is more than important than ever to take Vitamin D this winter as a lot of time will be spent indoors isolating and staying safe from coronavirus.\n\nThe sunlight, otherwise, is a key source.\n\nVitamin D is also found in oily fish and cereals.\n\nThe following people are said by BBC to be \"at risk\" of having low levels of Vitamin D even in summer and spring:\n\u2022 those with dark skin (such as people with African, African-Caribbean or south Asian backgrounds)\n\u2022 those who don't go outside often\n\u2022 those who cover up most of their skin when outdoors\n\nThese people are advised to ensure an all year long consumption of a Vitamin D supplement.\n\nDr Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at Public Health England, said: \"We advise that everyone \u2014 particularly the elderly, those who don't get outside and those with dark skin \u2014 takes a vitamin D supplement containing 10 micrograms (400IU) every day,\" she said.\n\n\"This year, the advice is more important than ever with more people spending more time inside.\"", "topic": "health", "tag": "headline", "types": [], "claim": "", "verdict": ""}, {"url": "https://www.channel4.com/news/more-than-two-million-cases-of-coronavirus-confirmed-in-the-uk", "source": "channel4.com", "authors": [], "title": "More than two million cases of coronavirus confirmed in the UK - Channel 4 News", "pubDate": "2020-12-19T19:01:01+00:00", "description": "There have now been more than two million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK, underlining the seriousness of the crisis.

As an actor, I'm familiar with those kind of questions, because, for example, with working in the Jurassic franchise, it's like, 'OK, we can have fun with some deep cuts for the fans, but, at the end of the day, it's about a good story, well told.\n\n\"'What is that balance? How might something that has been established in The Lost World or whatnot play a factor into the storytelling for Jurassic World: Dominion?'\"\n\n\n\n\"By the way, that's not a spoiler. I'm just making that up randomly right now!\" she added, laughing.\n\nHoward added that she feels that the existence of a \"larger world\" while telling a story can be \"a real asset\", because it provides added depth and richness to events and characters.\n\n\"If you're telling a story that is a biopic or something, and there's a bunch of characters that are smaller characters in that biopic, but you can go, and you can read about all of them, because they existed, and their lives are well-documented and whatnot, it's only going to better inform the biopic that's centring on the one character.\n\n\"Because you will have these fully fleshed out other characters that, even though it's not centralising on them, they're a part of the narrative.\"\n\nAs for The Mandalorian, Howard revealed that she is very aware of the need to appeal to both casual viewers and more devoted Star Wars fans, saying that \"plate-spinning\" is needed to provide a great viewing experience to both.\n\n\"I would liken that as well to The Mandalorian in that there are these stories of characters that exist, but even though they might not be playing a central role... Constantly in stories, there are new characters. But in this one, what's cool is, (if you are a super-fan), you will actually be caught up, and will have an understanding of the various layers of the scene,\" she said.\n\nRelated: The Mandalorian finale just changed the show forever\n\n\"But the scene needs to work for someone who's five years old and hasn't seen anything else. Again, that's the plate-spinning job of the series.\"\n\nShe added that she feels the involvement of executive producer Dave Filoni, who has worked on a number of Star Wars series, means that Star Wars fans expect \"richer\" storytelling and that the team try to incorporate this while keeping the action enjoyable for fans who are new to some established characters.\n\n\"I think to not connect The Mandalorian in any shape or form, especially with Dave Filoni's collaboration, it would personally feel like a missed opportunity,\" she said. \"As a fan, when I see Dave's name on something, I want the storytelling to be that much richer.\n\n\"I want to feel the specificity of the Star Wars universe be brought to life, especially when it's live-action. It's definitely a fine line. But that's part of the joy.\"\n\nThe Mandalorian season 1 and season 2 are streaming now on Disney+.\n\nStar Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and the entire Skywalker Saga are available on DVD, Blu-ray and 4K now, as well as on Disney+, while Rise of Skywalker is also on Sky Cinema Premiere and NOW TV.\n\nDigital Spy has launched its first-ever digital magazine with exclusive features, interviews, and videos.

The Telegraph also reported on Friday that government officials expected the AstraZeneca-Oxford University COVID-19 vaccine would clear regulatory approval on December 28 or 29, helping to accelerate the vaccination campaign.

a healthy person's blood oxygen levels are between 95 to 100 per cent.\n\n\"As a nurse, I have never seen someone walking and talking with an oxygen saturation level of just 44 per cent.\n\n\"We had only been in the ER for probably one hour when doctors decided they needed to put him on a ventilator.\"\n\nStephanie never expected that her son would not be leaving hospital.\n\nWhile Peyton suffered from a thyroid problem and had asthma, she did not consider him particularly at risk from the respiratory infection.\n\n\"I was scared he was going to be put on a ventilator but I also thought we'll get over this hump and bring him home.\"\n\nDoctors treated Peyton with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) where blood is temporarily removed from the body to allow artificial oxygenation of the red blood cells and the removal of carbon dioxide.\n\nHis condition worsened suddenly on Saturday 31 October when he began to haemorrhage.\n\n\"He had this big coughing fit and he basically started to haemorrhage in his chest.\n\n\"The surgeons were trying to replace the ECMO and they were doing CPR to help circulate his blood because his pulse was so weak and his oxygen levels were so low.\"\n\nAs doctors desperately tried to replace the ECMO tubes in Peyton's neck, the blood that had pooled in his chest sprayed over the walls.\n\nStephanie said: \"It was all over the cardiothoracic surgeon and he just kept working.\"\n\nStephanie, who had been granted special permission to be in the hospital as she had Covid, watched as 10 nurses and four doctors battled for an hour and 15 minutes to save her son's life before calling the time of death.\n\n\"Never did I ever think this was going to happen,\" Stephanie said.\n\n\"You don't hear about kids getting Covid and it being that serious.\n\n\"I was just in shock.\n\n\n\n Adding to Stephanie's pain, her sister Cyndi, a trauma registrar, came down with Covid a week before thanksgiving.\n\nShe was also put on a ventilator and received ECMO but she passed away on December 7.\n\n\"Every day is a struggle to get out of bed and go through the motions,\" Stephanie said.\n\nShe shared that the only positive has been reuniting with her ex boyfriend, Chris Lottmann, 43, a welder, whom Peyton adored.\n\n\"He was very close with Peyton and I called him to tell him that Peyton had passed away and he was devastated.\n\n\"We have got back together and he has been a huge source of support for me and he has been here for me every moment that I've needed it.\n\n\"We think it was Peyton's wish and our gift from Peyton that he got us back together - he really didn't want us to break up in the first place.\"\n\nStephanie paid tribute to her son, saying that he had made more friends in his 13 years than some people make in a lifetime.\n\n\"He was the sweetest boy and he made everyone smile.\n\n\"In his 13 years of life, he made more friends than someone would make if they lived to 85.\"\n\nStephanie is speaking out about her son's death in the hopes that it will make Americans take Covid seriously and follow health guidelines.\n\n\"I hope people will take Covid more seriously and not say it is a political agenda or some type of fakes news or that it is the same as the flu.\"\n\n\"We were so very careful,\" she said.\n\n\"If we ever went anywhere, we always wore masks and we always washed our hands and used hand sanitiser and we still got Covid.\n\n\"Our hearts go out to all the healthcare providers who are battling this on the front lines everyday.\"\n\nThe Chief Medical Officer at SSM Health Cardinal Glennon Children's Hospital, Dr. Marya Strand said: \"Despite the recent availability of vaccines, it is clear that our communities will need to continue to use appropriate caution and preventive measures to protect vulnerable populations.\n\n\"Masking, vigilant hand hygiene and physical distancing are the pillars of prevention during this pandemic.

Click here to watch.\n\n\u201cTo be able to make a rational choice you have to have a general awareness of the key facts that go into that rational decision and the key facts have to include . . . some sense of the degree of impact you\u2019re having on other people,\u201d Bytensky said during closing arguments on Friday, according to CBC News.\n\nBut prosecutors pushed back against that theory, arguing that Minassian\u2019s autism should not be considered in deciding his guilt.\n\n\u201cThis is about a person who committed mass murder who happened to have ASD, not that the ASD made him commit murders,\u201d prosecutor Joe Callaghan said during the court proceedings, according to CTV News.\n\nAmong those reasons, prosecutors say, was that Minassian considered himself part of the Incel community, a group of men who have labeled themselves \u201cinvoluntary celibate\u201d and sexually frustrated with women.\n\nEight of the ten people who died in the rampage were women, and Minassian told mental health assessors that he had doubts about being able to have a relationship with a woman.\n\nMinassian had also posted a message on Facebook shortly before the killings in which he indicated that he was part of the Incel community and was angry about not being able to develop relationships with women, according to the Daily Mail.\n\nThe post, which has been deleted, reportedly was a nod to a man who murdered six people and injured 13 others in a 2014 attack near the University of California, Santa Barbara. Minassian called the perpetrator \u201cthe Supreme Gentle\u201d and wrote: \u201cThe Incel Rebellion has already begun! We will overthrow all the Chads and Stacys!\u201d Chads and Stacys are used to describe people perceived to be more sexually active.\n\nMinassian also told mental health assessors that he was obsessed with a particular anonymous mass murderer, according to the Daily Mail. Minassian reportedly had planned to murder at least 100 people in a different attack but decided to ram his vehicle into people in a spur-of-the-moment decision while waiting at a red light. He was also fascinated by school shootings.\n\nDuring a police interview after the incident, Minassian told investigators that he hoped his attack would inspire copycats and that while he was disappointed he didn\u2019t kill more people, he felt like he did what he set out to do. \u201cI feel like I accomplished my mission,\u201d Minassian said, according to the Toronto Sun.\n\nJustice Anne Molloy, who presided over the case, commented Friday about the role that autism may play in her decision.\n\n\u201cLet me be clear, autism is not on trial, Alek Minassian is on trial,\u2019 Molloy said, according to CTV News. \u201cThe issue at this trial is whether the particular impact of ASD on this particular person at this particular point in time was such that he should not be held criminally responsible for his actions.\u201d\n\nFor the latest true crime and justice news, subscribe to the \u2018Crime Stories with Nancy Grace\u2019 podcast.

Right now. Today. Literally six flights a day. And all it takes is one person.'\n\nAuthorities had earlier said they were looking 'very carefully' into the virus variant spreading in the United Kingdom, while indicating that a ban on travel from there was not currently in the cards.\n\nCuomo called the US inaction on the new strain 'reprehensible' but Moncef Slaoui, chief advisor to the government's Operation Warp Speed vaccine program, told CNN's that US officials 'don't know yet' if the variant is present in the country.\n\n'We are, of course... looking very carefully into this,' including at the National Institutes of Health and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, he said.\n\nAt the moment, he said, no strain of the virus appears to be resistant to the vaccines available. 'This particular variant in the UK, I think, is very unlikely to have escaped the vaccine immunity,' Slaoui said.\n\n'I don't think there's any reason for alarm right now,' agreed Admiral Brett Giroir, the US official overseeing coronavirus testing, when asked about the new variant on ABC's The Week.\n\nThe US currently bars most non-American residents who have been in Europe in the previous 14 days. Those restrictions have been in place since March to address the coronavirus pandemic. Nearly all of Europe still bans most US travelers from visiting, while Britain allows American visits but requires a two-week quarantine on arrival.\n\nBut Cuomo hit back, telling reporters: '120 countries demand that before you get on a flight in the UK to come to their country, you have to have tested negative. The United States does not require it.\n\n'Now, to me this is reprehensible because this is what happened in the Spring. How many times in life do you have to make the same mistake before you learn?\n\n'The Port Authority has no authority to ban passengers, health monitor passengers, it's federal. Why at a minimum you wouldn't require a test like the 120 other countries, or why you wouldn't consider a ban like the other European countries?'\n\nAsked whether the United States was likely to follow the example of European countries that have suspended flights from the United Kingdom, Giroir replied: 'I really don't believe we need to do that yet.'\n\nSlaoui and Giroir's comments followed reports on Friday that President Donald Trump is considering lifting America's travel ban on the UK and Europe as early as next week.\n\nTrump is expected to authorize the lifting of the travel ban through an executive order on Tuesday, The Telegraph reported, citing senior sources in the travel industry.\n\nYet on Sunday a slew of countries banned travel from the UK. France has joined Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, Bulgaria, Germany, Israel and El Salvador in banning all flights carrying passengers from the UK.\n\nOne road haulage boss told the BBC that while lorries are still allowed from France to the UK, he feared that many European drivers would be unwilling to make the trip fearing they could not get home for Christmas \u2013 meaning British supermarket shelves could empty.\n\nHe told the broadcaster: \u2018Just when you thought it couldn\u2019t get any worse \u2013 disaster upon disaster. I fear for supermarket supply chains. Many will be reluctant to make the crossing to UK if they can\u2019t get back given there is already congestion.'\n\nThe Eurotunnel Le Shuttle has said that the UK-France border will close at 11pm on Sunday night and the last shuttle between the UK and France is at 9.24pm with access to the UK prohibited from 10pm.\n\nIt comes as the Eurostar has also cancelled its trains between London, Brussels in Belgium and Amsterdam in the Netherlands, starting from Monday.\n\nThe Netherlands was the first country to announce a travel ban, which will remain in place until January 1, its government said in a statement early today.\n\nFrance's Prime Minister Jean Castex tweeted: 'All flows of people from the United Kingdom to France are suspended from midnight tonight, for 48 hours, and for all means of transport.'\n\nIreland has imposed a 48-hour travel ban on non-essential flights from Britain from midnight which includes passengers on flights and ferries. However there will be no ban or travel restrictions for passengers travelling between the Republic and Northern Ireland.\n\nGermany announced all UK flights, with the exception of cargo flights, would no longer be allowed to land in the country.\n\nBelgium also said it was suspending flight and train arrivals from Britain from midnight for 24 hours.\n\nItaly's health minister Roberto Speranza said an order was signed today blocking flights from Britain and preventing anyone who had been to the UK in the last 14 days from entering Italy. The order bans plane travel until January 6.\n\nMeanwhile El Salvador has banned travellers who have been in the UK or South Africa in the last 30 days or whose flights included a layover those countries.\n\nOn November 25, Reuters reported the White House was considering rescinding entry bans for most non-US citizens who recently were in Brazil, Britain, Ireland and 26 other European countries.\n\nSince then there has been no decision by President Donald Trump, but UK officials have held a series of high-level talks with White House and Cabinet officials.\n\nThe White House declined to comment on Friday.\n\nBut in an email to Reuters, a spokeswoman for the UK Department for Transport said 'restarting transatlantic flights is of critical importance to the economic recovery of the UK and the US, the airline industry and for British nationals, most of whom cannot enter the US.\n\n'British officials continue to pursue the resolution to this issue.'\n\nNearly eight million more COVID-19 vaccine doses are to ship across the United States on Monday, Slaoui told CNN on Tuesday - two million of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and 5.9 million of the Moderna shot that was greenlighted on Friday.\n\nThe first Moderna shot was 'most likely to be tomorrow morning,' he said.\n\nSlaoui spoke after some states had complained of delays in receiving doses of the Pfizer vaccine - a delay which General Gus Perna, who is overseeing the logistical operation as part of Operation Warp Speed, apologized for on Saturday.\n\n'We will work and learn from our mistakes,' Slaoui said. The US government still expects 20 million people to be vaccinated by the end of the year or the first week of January.\n\nWhile Vice President Mike Pence has done so publicly, and President-elect Joe Biden is to do so Monday, President Donald Trump has so far not indicated he will take the vaccine any time soon.\n\nWith vaccine skepticism a concern, Giroir encouraged Trump to do so for his own health - 'and also to generate more confidence among the people who follow him so closely.'\n\nBut surgeon general Jerome Adams told CBS's Face the Nation that, due to the antibodies the president received during his own bout with COVID-19, 'that is actually one scenario where we tell people maybe you should hold off on getting the vaccine'.\n\nMore than 316,000 people have been killed by COVID-19 in the United States, with new daily infections regularly topping 200,000 and deaths hovering at around 3,000 people every 24 hours.\n\nWith vaccines on the move there is light at the end of the tunnel - but Slaoui warned the situation will 'get worse' before it gets better, citing a surge after Thanksgiving and the coming year-end holidays.\n\nOn Sunday, incoming Biden administration surgeon general Vivek Murthy told NBC's Meet the Press that he expects the general public to receive vaccinations by mid-summer or early fall.\n\nOn Sunday the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisory panel said that frontline essential workers and persons 75 years and older should be prioritized.\n\nAround 30million first responders, teachers, food and agriculture workers, those in manufacturing, the U.S. Postal Service, public transit, and grocery store workers, have been included in the first group, after months of consultation.\n\nThe panel voted 13-1 in favor of the move that, in all, would make 49 million people eligible to receive the vaccine in the next round.\n\nAdults 75 and older, about 19 million people, were included as they account for 25 percent of hospitalizations and a significant share of deaths from COVID-19.\n\nThe recommendations will guide state authorities in deciding who should have priority to receive limited doses of vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and the Moderna.\n\nThe group also voted on a subsequent, secondary priority group.\n\nAround 57 million non-frontline workers, like those in media, finance, energy and IT communication industries, and persons in the age group of 65-74 and those aged 16-64 years with high-risk conditions are proposed to receive the vaccine in the ensuing round, as reported by Reuters.\n\nStates will still have the flexibility to make decisions locally.\n\nGrace Lee, a committee member and a professor of pediatrics at Stanford University School of Medicine, warned that the industries chosen 'are going to be imperfect', as reported in The Washington Post.\n\nThe 14 members of the panel have been working on how to balance fairness and speed since the wider global outbreak of the novel coronavirus in spring.\n\nSince then they have held nearly a dozen public meetings to examine evidence to address how best to balance saving the lives of the most vulnerable against stopping the spread of the virus, whilst addressing health inequities related to race, wealth, industry, geography and more.\n\nChuck Schumer said late Saturday night that there will likely be a vote in the 'House and Senate' on the next coronavirus relief package before extended funding expires at midnight on Sunday.\n\nThe Senate minority leader left the Capitol around 11:00pm on Saturday and told a reporter outside his office 'we're getting very close' to a deal.\n\n'It looks like we'll be able to [vote in the House and Senate].

The couple had met in September while he was legally working on the island as a roofer.\n\nThe police report states that Radcliffe was totally unaware that McLaughlan had risked life to meet her, and the couple enjoyed a date at the 1886 Bar & Grill and the Bordello Wine Bar in Douglas until around 1:30 am on Dec. 13.\n\nIt was at this stage, however, that local law enforcement caught up with him. Before he left the U.K. mainland, McLaughlan had filled out a route planner for the coast guard. When he didn't return as scheduled the U.K. authorities alerted search and rescue and filed a missing person's notice to local police forces.\n\nThis included the Isle of Man Constabulary who were alerted to the presence of their new arrival. On the evening of Dec. 13, around 16 hours after he'd left the wine bar, McLaughlan was arrested.\n\nAfter confessing his plan to illegally travel to the country, he was charged with one count of breaching the island's COVID regulations and sentenced to four weeks in jail.\n\n\"Restrictions are in place at the Island\u2019s borders to prevent the spread of the virus,\" adds Quayle in the release. \" This individual arrived on the Island with no exemption notice or entry permit and failed to declare their arrival or to self-isolate.\"\n\n\"This individual was aware of the law and showed a flagrant disregard when they chose to break it, mixing in the community and potentially putting lives at risk.\"\n\nHe continues, \"I hope this sends a strong signal to others who do not take our laws seriously or who are mistaken in thinking that the rules do not apply to them.\"", "topic": "general", "tag": "headline", "types": [], "claim": "", "verdict": ""}, {"url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/tosv2.html?vid=&uuid=74b61c20-4318-11eb-9123-03e8f0ff9bcd&url=L25ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjAyMC0xMi0yMC9ncml6emx5LXMtY2FuY2VsZWQtZGVsaXZlcnktaXMtYS13YXJuaW5nLW9mLWJyZXhpdC10cm91YmxlLWFoZWFk", "source": "bloomberg.com", "authors": [], "title": "Grizzly\u2019s Canceled Delivery Is a Warning of Brexit Trouble Ahead - Bloomberg", "pubDate": "2020-12-20T05:00:00+00:00", "description": "", "imageUrl": "", "language": "en", "country": "us", "content": "Why did this happen?\n\nPlease make sure your browser supports JavaScript and cookies and that you are not blocking them from loading.

We need to meet the moment with the urgency it demands as we would during any national emergency.\u201d\n\nThe approach is a shift from Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, which has been marked by efforts to boost oil and gas production while rolling back government efforts intended to safeguard the environment. The incoming Biden team will try to undo or block many of the current administration\u2019s initiatives. There also will be an emphasis on looking out for the low-income, working class and minority communities hit hardest by fossil fuel pollution and climate change.\n\nIn his remarks, Biden stressed the diversity of an emerging team that he described as \u201cbrilliant, qualified, tested and barrier-busting.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlready there are more people of color in our Cabinet than any Cabinet ever,\u201d said the former vice president, who has promised to assemble a group of department leaders who reflect the diversity of America.\n\nIf confirmed by the Senate, New Mexico Rep. Deb Haaland would be the first Native American to lead the Interior Department, which has wielded influence over the nation\u2019s tribes for generations. Former two-term Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm is in line to be energy secretary.\n\nNorth Carolina official Michael Regan would be the first African American man to run the Environmental Protection Agency. Regan, the state environmental head since 2017, has made a name for himself by pursuing cleanups of industrial toxins and helping the low-income and minority communities significantly affected by pollution.\n\nBiden\u2019s nominee to oversee the Council on Environmental Quality is Brenda Mallory. The office oversees environmental reviews for virtually all major infrastructure projects and advises the president on major environmental issues. If confirmed, she would be the first African American to hold the position since it was created more than half a century ago.\n\nTwo other members of the team introduced Saturday do not need Senate confirmation. They are Gina McCarthy, to serve as national climate adviser, and Ali Zaidi, to serve as her deputy.

The Second Sino-Japanese War between 1937 and 1945 cost 25 million civilian lives and another four million Chinese and Japanese soldiers.\n\nThe Taiping Rebellion is still the fourth worst conflict in history, outranking World War I.\n\nWhen did World War II start? Most would say in 1939 when Hitler's Germany invaded Poland.\n\nBut there is another date overlooked. In 1937, Chinese and Japanese troops clashed outside of Beijing in what is known as the Marco Polo Bridge incident.\n\nIt began a conflict that would not end until the Japanese surrender in 1945. In China, historians go back even further to 1931 when the Japanese first attacked Manchuria, as the first shots of war.\n\nThere is so little we know about China, a country that has been at the centre of global power for thousands of years and is reshaping the 21st century.\n\nIt is a blood soaked land where history hangs heavy. In China there is a saying \"to eat bitterness\", it comes from a long dark winter.\n\nChina's leader, Xi Jinping, reminds his people never to forget the century of humiliation: the hundred years of domination and exploitation by foreign powers.\n\nWhere do we begin to understand this country? I have spent decades reading, writing and thinking about China. I spent many years as a correspondent covering this fascinating, intimidating, frightening and inspiring place.\n\nThis holiday season when we often choose books as gifts, what's a good place to start with China?\n\nIf there is one collection of books I would recommend it is The Cambridge History of China: 15 massive volumes that constitute the most comprehensive history of China in the English language.\n\nDaunting I know, and expensive: each volume costs upwards of $150. But give up drinking alcohol, or gambling, or coffee and invest in this (or go to the library). Read nothing else for a year and you will change the way you see the world.\n\nIf 15 volumes is too much, then read the volumes on the Qing Dynasty. It is impossible to understand modern China without understanding the fall of the Qing.\n\nThe period from the Opium Wars with Britain beginning in the 1840s to the triumph of the Communist Revolution in 1949 was a dark night of the soul for China.\n\nIt lost its place in the world and was tipped into unending war, revolution, famine, and return as a great power.\n\nMao: The Real Story by Alexander Pantsov and Steven I Levine\n\n\"No Mao, no China\": I heard this refrain constantly during my years reporting the country. No figure looms over modern China more than the revolutionary leader, Mao Zedong.\n\nHe was a soldier, philosopher and poet who rose from a peasant family (albeit relatively well off) to lead the country.\n\nHe was a man who believed in constant chaos and turmoil. Revolution, he famously said, was \"not a dinner party\".\n\nHe is a man who launched the Cultural Revolution that is blamed for the deaths of millions of people, yet he remains revered in China today. Mao's image is in almost every home and his enormous portrait hangs at the gates of the Forbidden City in Beijing.\n\nThere are many books on Mao, but I would recommend Mao: The Real Story by historians Alexander Pantsov and Steven I Levine.\n\nThey track him from birth to power. It does not deny the horrors Mao inflicted on his people yet recognises that he \"transformed China from a semi-colony into an independent and powerful state\".\n\nJulia Lovell is a historian who has also written about Mao and how Maoism transformed China into a centre of global revolution.\n\nLovell's books cover the Great Wall of China, and the Opium Wars, and are well researched, breezily written and accessible.\n\nJude D Blanchette charts the rise of the neo-Maoists in his book China's New Red Guards\n\nIt is essential to understanding the hold that Mao still has on the country and what has shaped the current leader, Xi Jinping.\n\nInside the Mind of Xi Jinping by Francoise Bougon\n\nOn that count, Francoise Bougon's Inside the Mind of Xi Jinping is a wonderful philosophical meditation on a man who has been called the most powerful leader in the world.\n\nThe Party: The Secret World of China's Communist Rulers by Richard McGregor\n\nFor Xi Jinping there is no China without the Communist Party; his China Dream is a rich, powerful nation where the Party controls every aspect of life.\n\nThere is no better single book on the subject than Richard McGregor's The Party: The Secret World of China's Communist Rulers.\n\nMcGregor is not just a student of China, but spent many years reporting the country, our paths criss-crossing in Beijing.\n\nKerry Brown is another renowned China watcher who has released a series of books on the country, each of them compact, readable and full of insight.\n\nI am fortunate enough to have had a career where I have covered the great stories of our time. I am not allowed to have professional envy but if there is one journalist I wish I could have been it is Edgar Snow.\n\nThe American journalist was the first Western reporter to tell the story of the Communist Revolution, with unparalleled access to Mao Zedong.\n\nIn the history of journalistic scoops it doesn't come any better than that.\n\nHis book Red Star over China has been praised and deeply criticised. He certainly helped create the myth of Mao. His book is deeply flawed but essential, and what journalist would not have wanted to walk in his shoes.\n\nElizabeth Economy, Susan Shirk, Geremie Barme, David Shambaugh, Stephen Platt, Roderick MacFarquhar and Michael Schoenhals are all worth tracking down and reading.\n\nBut we must not forget Chinese writers\n\nOf course it is impossible to understand China simply through foreign eyes.\n\nI would urge anyone to seek out writers like Wang Hui and his books China's Twentieth Century and China From Empire to Nation State, as well as Ge Zhaoguang's book What is China: Territory, Ethnicity, Culture and History.\n\nTo grasp the suffering of the Chinese people, there is no book more harrowing than Yang Jisheng's Tombstone, which tells us the story of the Great Famine. Yang a former journalist for state media, spent 15 years trawling through documents to reveal a horror that the Communist Party would prefer written out of history.\n\nNations are written into life. All nations are a story and there are many wonderful Chinese novelists. If I can choose one to read this summer it is Yiyun Li.\n\nLi grew up in Beijing and migrated to the United States to work as an immunologist. Her books are evocative and painful. Her novels carry the weight of history and the inheritance of trauma.\n\nShe writes in English but her memories and her stories are Chinese. Li asks a question that haunts her homeland: what is the cost of memory?\n\nYiyun Li writes in English as an act forgetting: she is trying to erase the language that for her speaks to unbearable pain.\n\nAs she once said: \"It's the absoluteness of my abandonment of Chinese, undertaken with such determination, that it is a kind of suicide.\"", "topic": "general", "tag": "headline", "types": [], "claim": "", "verdict": ""}, {"url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/12/20/universities-struggle-survive-winter/", "source": "telegraph.co.uk", "authors": ["Michael O'Dwyer", "Hannah Uttley", "Rachel Millard", "Simon Johnson", "Roger Bootle", "Laura Onita"], "title": "Universities in struggle to survive the winter - Telegraph.co.uk", "pubDate": "2020-12-20T15:00:00+00:00", "description": "Courses and campuses could go, with some institutions fighting to avoid going bust after the Government avoided a bailout", "imageUrl": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/education-and-careers/2020/09/07/TELEMMGLPICT000202888429_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?impolicy=logo-overlay", "language": "en", "country": "gb", "content": "As Covid brought the usual bustle of London\u2019s Russell Square to a grinding halt this year, a small cohort of students carried on studying from the six-floor library just yards away in the School of Oriental and African Studies (Soas).\n\nThe university\u2019s 5,200 students have mostly adapted well to the crisis, including the group that studied surrounded by more than a million books and manuscripts in the 97,000 sq ft library, says Monika Nangia, who oversees student and academic services at Soas, part of the University of London.\n\nEquipping staff to teach online was a bigger challenge but that too has been overcome, she says: \u201cInitially there were some hiccups.

GM is not even on the table.\n\nTo my thinking this can only mean Tesla (TSLA). Now I could be wrong here as Tesla is not named in the news release; but there is only one \u201cmajor global EV leader\u201d that is \u201cAmerican based\u201d. So as readers you can also draw your own conclusions.\n\n\u201cMr. Dan Blondal is pleased to announce that Nano One has entered into a cathode evaluation and benchmark agreement with an American based multinational auto manufacturer to jointly evaluate Nano One\u2019s cathode materials for automotive lithium ion batteries.\u201d\n\nNano One Materials Corp. (TSXV: NNO | FF: LBMB | OTC: NNOMF) (\u201cNano One\u201d) announced earlier today that they have entered \u201cinto a Cathode Evaluation Agreement with Major Global Automotive Company \u201c. In the news release Nano One CEO Dan Blondal quotes \u201c major global EV leader \u201c. The release also quotes:\n\nDigging deeper into today\u2019s announcement from Nano One it states:\n\n\u201cThis agreement formalizes efforts that began earlier this year and aligns Nano One with its second major automotive company. These are formative steps in developing a long term relationship. We are confident that given economic viability it will lead to commercial opportunities and strategies to integrate Nano One\u2019s technologies into the electric vehicle value chain.\u201d\n\nThe first major automotive company was Volkswagen. So if I am right that Nano One is now working with Tesla, it means Nano One is now in collaboration with the top two global electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers. By 2030 Tesla plans to be selling 20M EVs pa and I would think Volkswagen would plan to at least match or beat that. Therefore all going particularly well, Nano One\u2019s cathode materials for automotive lithium ion batteries could potentially be used in ~40M new EVs pa by 2030. It is not yet known if all of the Tesla/Volkswagen EVs will necessarily use the Nano One cathode materials Intellectual property. Also at this point these deals are not yet finalized into commercial contracts, so for now this is only speculation on what might be possible down the road for Nano One.\n\nLast month I wrote here on InvestorIntel an article titled: \u201cNano One looks to be moving in the same direction as EV leader Tesla\u201d, where I discussed Nano One\u2019s single crystal cathode proprietary one-pot process to develop a low cost, cobalt-free lithium nickel manganese (LNM) cathode active material. That news tied in perfectly to what Elon Musk was saying at Tesla Battery Day in September where he discussed using sulfate-free metals rather than hydroxides and making a nickel manganese battery.\n\n\u201cNano One\u2019s One-Pot process forms durable single crystal cathode powders and protective coatings simultaneously, directly from sulfate-free metal salts and lithium carbonate. It is an environmentally inspired process using limited water and produces no waste stream. The process eliminates intermediate products, additional coating steps and the costly requirements for metal-sulfates and lithium hydroxide feedstocks.\u201d\n\nFurthermore Nano One\u2019s November 24 announcement on a breakthrough in battery longevity further strengthens their case for ultimately winning multiple EV manufacturer or battery/cathode manufacturer contracts. Nano One stated: \u201cNano One\u2019s proprietary LNM battery enables the benefits of increased voltage, elevated operating temperatures and fast charging\u2026\u2026We have also reached 1000 fast charge and discharge cycles at 25\u00b0C demonstrating that issues of excessive gassing, anode contamination and poor cycling may be overcome.\u201d\n\nNano One continues to talk to and form agreements with the very top tier EV companies. We know that they are already working with Volkswagen and Pulead Technology (a leading LFP cathode maker) and this latest agreement, in my view, is almost certain to be with Tesla (speculation on my part for now). Should success follow and a Tesla contract be forthcoming it would not be hard to imagine all the other EV manufacturers lining up at Nano One\u2019s doorstep.\n\nNano One has a market cap of around C$370M with the global cathode market forecast to be a US$23 billion market by 2025. Nano One is targeting about US$1 billion in potential licensing opportunity within the cathode market and certainly looks well on track to potentially succeed at this stage.\n\nDisclosure: The author is long Nano One (TSXV: NNO).", "topic": "business", "tag": "headline", "types": [], "claim": "", "verdict": ""}, {"url": "https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/testing-for-covid-can-be-faster-and-easier-for-those-canadians-willing-to-pay-for-it", "source": "nationalpost.com", "authors": ["National Post"], "title": "Testing for COVID can be faster and easier, for those Canadians willing to pay for it - National Post", "pubDate": "2020-12-18T23:32:22+00:00", "description": "The tests won\u2019t be available to everyone.

But it will operate flights from the Republic of Ireland to the UK in order to facilitate the repatriation of customers to the UK and those with connecting flights in the UK.\n\nRyanair said it would email all customers whose flights are banned by EU governments offering them other options including \u201cfree moves [no change fee applies] or refunds if they so wish\u201d.\n\nThe airline confirmed it would operate all those services to or from the UK that are permitted to fly.\n\n\u201cIf any such passengers [booked on operating flights] do not wish to travel during the next five days prior to Christmas, then Ryanair will facilitate a free move of their booking [no change fee applies] to any date up to March 15th,\u201d the airline said.\n\nAer Lingus said all passengers, regardless of fare type, could change travel dates free of charge as often as they wanted, up to two hours before flying, until June 16th. Customers may have to pay a fare difference if they do this.\n\n\u201cDepending on the fare type opted for at time of booking, customers may also be entitled to a voucher or full refund,\u201d the company added.\n\nAer Lingus passengers who pay for its mid-priced \u201cplus/smart\u201d fares can request a voucher up to 14 days before travel, or within 14 days if a country\u2019s Covid status changes.\n\nThose on the cheapest \u201csaver\u201d fare can change their flights for nothing as often as they like, but cannot seek vouchers or an alternative.\n\nThe Government\u2019s ban on flights from Britain applies for an initial 48 hours, until the Cabinet meets on Tuesday. Reports said the coalition was likely to allow some flights for essential workers and other purposes.\n\nMany of the 150,000 passengers due to pass through Cork and Dublin airports between this week and January 4th are likely to be travelling between the Republic and Britain.\n\nIn the UK, British Airways said it would not return cash to travellers who opted to cancel year-end trips.\n\nThe airline, part of International Airlines Group with Aer Lingus, said it would grant ticket holders a voucher or let them switch to a later date but only refund fares if it cancels a flight.\n\nThe refund issue ignited a firestorm when similar curbs were in place last month. Last week, the UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) began scrutinising whether airlines violated consumer rights by failing to offer passengers their money back for flights they couldn\u2019t lawfully take.\n\n\u201cSome airlines like EasyJet have mostly been doing the right thing and offering refunds, while others like BA only offer the option of a voucher or a rebooking,\u201d said Rory Boland, travel editor at consumer advocacy group Which?. \u201cThe CMA investigation is looking precisely into this, as the wording for Tier 4 restrictions indicates these are legal requirements, not guidance so you should be due a refund.\u201d", "topic": "business", "tag": "headline", "types": [], "claim": "", "verdict": ""}, {"url": "https://www.wirralglobe.co.uk/news/18955686.changes-wirral-bin-collection-times-festive-period/", "source": "wirralglobe.co.uk", "authors": ["Rebecca McGrath"], "title": "Changes for some Wirral bin collection times over the festive period - Wirral Globe", "pubDate": "2020-12-20T13:00:00+00:00", "description": "THERE will be some\u00a0changes to\u00a0grey and green bin collection days\u00a0over the festive period.", "imageUrl": "https://www.wirralglobe.co.uk/resources/images/12157192/", "language": "en", "country": "gb", "content": "THERE will be some changes to grey and green bin collection days over the festive period.\n\nThis year only residents who have their bin collected on a Friday are affected.\n\nBins scheduled for collection on Friday (Christmas Day) will now be collected on Sunday 27 December.\n\nBins scheduled for collection on Friday January 1 (New Year's Day) will be collected on Saturday, January 2.\n\nBins should be put out for collection by 7am on the new collection day, as usual.\n\nAll other collections (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday) will be collected as normal and there is no need for residents to do anything differently.\n\nWirral's garden waste collection service are reminded that the service shut down on December 14 for its annual break over Christmas and New Year until January 11.\n\nFor those with a real Christmas tree, once taken down and decorations stored safely for next year, the tree can be chopped up and put in the brown bin ready for the first collection of 2021.\n\nBin collection days can be checked online on the council\u2019s website.\n\nAll recycling centres/tips in Wirral will be open as normal every day over the festive period excluding Christmas Day, Boxing Day and New Year's Day.

It\u2019s good for your soul, I think, to work. And it\u2019s also good for your soul to be told you have done a good job, whatever job you do.\u201d\n\nWeaver\u2019s first surprise Academy Award nomination, in 2011, for her steely, against-type performance as a suburban crime matriarch in Animal Kingdom, might have had a big impact on the kind of projects she was offered, but it didn\u2019t really alter her work habits.\n\nAfter wrapping principal photography on David Mich\u00f4d\u2019s underworld drama, the actress appeared in six plays across Australia \u2013 including a widely acclaimed production of Uncle Vanya starring Cate Blanchett, Richard Roxburgh and Hugo Weaving, and a regional tour of Steel Magnolias.\n\n\u201cCountry people knew I was working because they used to see me every few months in another play,\u201d says Weaver.\n\nWhether she\u2019s sparring on screen with Robert De Niro in Silver Linings Playbook or treading the boards opposite Michael Caton in a bare-bones theatrical production in an Australian country town, her criteria for taking a role are simple. First, she has to like the story. Beyond that? The character has to have some kind of a journey.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be Shakespeare,\u201d Weaver says in a Zoom interview from the freshly painted apartment she and her husband Sean Taylor recently bought in Los Angeles. A well-stocked bookcase warms the wall behind her.\n\n\u201cI mean, I\u2019d love just to do Tom Stoppard plays and only work with Martin Scorsese or Quentin Tarantino, but there are thousands of storytellers out there who have a decent story to tell.\u201d\n\nBesides, those two Oscar nominations (the other came for Silver Linings Playbook) mean something. Namely, she says with a laugh, \u201cThe second one proves the first one wasn\u2019t a fluke.\u201d\n\nBut the 73-year-old isn\u2019t convinced that those performances are even her best. \u201cI thought I did a good job [in Animal Kingdom] but I was pretty overwhelmed by the reaction it got,\u201d she admits. \u201cAnd I have also done some good things that didn\u2019t get so much attention.\u201d\n\nTaylor, for instance, believes his wife\u2019s work as Lee Harvey Oswald\u2019s mother in Parkland is one of her best. \u201cAnd that passed without much of a ripple,\u201d observes Weaver. \u201cYou go into everything thinking, \u2018This could be the best thing I\u2019ve ever done\u2019, even if you\u2019ve only got two or three scenes.\u201d\n\nWeaver doesn\u2019t have a lot of screen time in Penguin Bloom, an upcoming film based on the true story of an injured magpie that helped an Australian family overcome their grief, but she still makes an indelible impression.\n\nOne can sense the heartache and impotence that underpin her character\u2019s busybody behaviour as she hovers over her daughter, Sam (Naomi Watts), who has been paralysed from the chest down in a freak accident.\n\nWeaver met Watts briefly at the 2013 Oscars, where they were fellow nominees. \u201cI didn\u2019t really know Naomi apart from that and I hadn\u2019t worked with her before,\u201d she says. \u201cThat was the reason I wanted to do the film. I\u2019ve been a huge admirer of Naomi\u2019s ever since Mulholland Dr. It was great to observe her up close. She\u2019s terrific.\u201d\n\nDirector Glendyn Ivin\u2019s poignant adaptation of Cameron Bloom and Bradley Trevor Greive\u2019s bestselling book was one of the last films Weaver made before international borders were closed by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe inspirational drama was shot on location at the Blooms\u2019 real house, on a hill overlooking the ocean north of Sydney. \u201cFilming where we did brings home to you just how physically beautiful it is,\u201d says Weaver. \u201cIt\u2019s 100 miles of the most spectacular harbour and coastline. We tend to take that for granted.\u201d\n\nNot anymore. One of the few downsides to Weaver\u2019s late-career revival is the distance it puts between her and her family, including son Dylan, daughter-in-law Makiko, and her two grandchildren. \u201cI do miss them,\u201d the actor says. Still, the past eight months in virtual lockdown overseas have kept her busy with distractions.\n\nWhile the four projects Weaver had lined up prior to the pandemic have been shelved or postponed, she recently spent a month in Montana filming a guest role on the Kevin Costner TV series Yellowstone.\n\n\u201cIt was a strange experience because the coronavirus protocols were really strict. We were tested every day. We couldn\u2019t go anywhere. We wore masks. Nobody could go near anybody on set.\u201d\n\nAnd there\u2019s the matter of her new home. After a decade renting in West Hollywood, she and Taylor finally decided to put down some roots. \u201cIt\u2019s just a modest little flat, about 10 minutes from where we were living,\u201d she says. So there are plenty of moving boxes to finish unpacking and decorating to be done.\n\nShe has also been quietly developing a couple of projects of her own, even if she has no idea where they will go. \u201cHeaven knows when they are going to be able to be produced! I think we\u2019re stuck with this for quite a while.\u201d\n\nWeaver says lockdown confirmed her suspicions that she\u2019s a definite introvert. \u201cJust having my husband and my dog to talk to hasn\u2019t bothered me at all,\u201d she says. \u201cThe things I miss the most are intimate bars \u2013 I like a drink in a cosy bar \u2013 and the cinema.\u201d\n\nBefore the pandemic, she and Taylor went to the movies two or three times a week: \u201cYou only do justice to a filmmaker\u2019s vision if you see it in a proper cinema.\u201d But she hardly misses the attendant opening-night functions that come with the job.\n\nShe may be drawn to extroverts \u2013 \u201cThey are entertaining and bring out the best in people. I used to have a lovely time being with Derryn [Hinch, to whom she was \u201chappily married\u201d for 12 years], because I didn\u2019t have to say much at all. I could just observe and listen\u201d \u2013 but trying to force conversation with them in that environment can be a punish.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like parties. I find them difficult \u2013 talking to strangers about meaningless things. My husband and I usually find a corner and sit there... talking to each other.\u201d\n\nWhy Claudia Karvan stripped down to her underwear\n\nMelissa Tkautz: \u2018Simon Baker was my first real love\u2019", "topic": "entertainment", "tag": "headline", "types": [], "claim": "", "verdict": ""}, {"url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-20/yellen-pressed-to-back-strong-dollar-in-reversing-trump-era-tone", "source": "bloomberg.com", "authors": [], "title": "Yellen Pressed to Back Strong Dollar in Reversing Trump-Era Tone - Bloomberg", "pubDate": "2020-12-20T21:00:00+00:00", "description": "", "imageUrl": "", "language": "en", "country": "us", "content": "Why did this happen?\n\nPlease make sure your browser supports JavaScript and cookies and that you are not blocking them from loading.

His speech has not been previously reported.\n\nYet even as he spoke, hackers were embedding malicious code into the network of a Texas software company called SolarWinds Corp, according to a timeline published by Microsoft and more than a dozen government and corporate cyber researchers.\n\nA little over three weeks after that dinner, the hackers began a sweeping intelligence operation that has penetrated the heart of America\u2019s government and numerous corporations and other institutions around the world.\n\nThe results of that operation came to light on Dec. 13, when Reuters reported that suspected Russian hackers had gained access to U.S. Treasury and Commerce Department emails. Since then, officials and researchers say they believe at least half-a-dozen U.S. government agencies have been infiltrated and thousands of companies infected with malware in what appears to be one of the biggest such hacks ever uncovered.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Friday Russia was behind the attack, calling it \u201ca grave risk\u201d to the United States. Russia has denied involvement.\n\nRevelations of the attack come at a vulnerable time as the U.S. government grapples with a contentious presidential transition and a spiraling public health crisis. And it reflects a new level of sophistication and scale, hitting numerous federal agencies and threatening to inflict far more damage to public trust in America\u2019s cybersecurity infrastructure than previous acts of digital espionage.\n\nMuch remains unknown -- including the motive or ultimate target.\n\nSeven government officials have told Reuters they are largely in the dark about what information might have been stolen or manipulated -- or what it will take to undo the damage. The last known breach of U.S. federal systems by suspected Russian intelligence -- when hackers gained access to the unclassified email systems at the White House, the State Department and the Joint Chiefs of Staff in 2014 and 2015 -- took years to unwind.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday downplayed the hack and Russia\u2019s involvement, maintaining it was \u201cunder control\u201d and that China could be responsible. He accused the \u201cFake News Media\u201d of exaggerating its extent.\n\nThe NSC, however, acknowledged that a \u201csignificant cyber incident\u201d had taken place. \u201cThere will be an appropriate response to those actors behind this conduct,\u201d said NSC spokesman John Ullyot. He did not respond to a question on whether Trump had evidence of Chinese involvement in the attack.\n\nSeveral government agencies, including the NSA and the Department of Homeland Security, have issued technical advisories on the situation. Nakasone and the NSA declined to comment for this story.\n\nLawmakers from both parties said they were struggling to get answers from the departments they oversee, including Treasury. One senate staffer said his boss knew more about the attack from the media than the government.\n\nThe hack first came into view last week, when U.S. cybersecurity firm FireEye Inc disclosed that it had itself been a victim of the very kind of cyberattack that clients pay it to prevent.\n\nPublicly, the incident initially seemed mostly like an embarrassment for FireEye. But hacks of security firms are especially dangerous because their tools often reach deeply into the computer systems of their clients.\n\nDays before the hack was revealed, FireEye researchers knew something troubling was afoot and contacted Microsoft Corp and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, three people involved in those communications told Reuters. Microsoft and the FBI declined to comment.\n\nTheir message: FireEye has been hit by an extraordinarily sophisticated cyber-espionage campaign carried out by a nation-state, and its own problems were likely just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nAbout half a dozen researchers from FireEye and Microsoft, set about investigating, said two sources familiar with the response effort. At the root of the problem, they found, was something that strikes dread in cybersecurity professionals: so-called supply-chain compromises, which in this case involved using software updates to install malware that can spy on systems, exfiltrate information and potentially wreak other types of havoc.\n\nIn 2017, Russian operatives used the technique to knock out private and government computer systems across Ukraine, after hiding a piece of malicious code in a widely used accountancy program that was then used to deploy a destructive virus known as NotPetya. Russia has denied that it was involved. The malware quickly infected computers in scores of other countries, crippling businesses and causing hundreds of millions of dollars of damage.\n\nThe latest U.S. hack employed a similar technique: SolarWinds said its software updates had been compromised and used to surreptitiously install malicious code in nearly 18,000 customer systems. Its Orion network management software is used by hundreds of thousands of organizations.\n\nOnce downloaded, the program signaled back to its operators where it had landed. In some cases where access was especially valuable, the hackers used it to deploy more active malicious software to spread across its host.\n\nIn some of the attacks, the intruders combined the administrator privileges granted to SolarWinds with Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud platform - which stores customers\u2019 data online - to forge authentication \u201ctokens.\u201d Those gave them far longer and wider access to emails and documents than many organizations thought was possible.\n\nHackers could then steal documents through Microsoft\u2019s Office 365, the online version of its most popular business software, the NSA said on Thursday in an unusual technical public advisory. Also on Thursday, Microsoft announced it found malicious code in its systems.\n\nA separate advisory issued by the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency on Dec. 17 said that the SolarWinds software was not the only vehicle being used in the attacks and that the same group had likely used other methods to implant malware.\n\n\u201cThis is powerful tradecraft, and needs to be understood to defend important networks,\u201d Rob Joyce, a senior NSA cybersecurity adviser, said on Twitter.\n\nIt is unknown how or when SolarWinds was first compromised. According to researchers at Microsoft and other firms that have investigated the hack, intruders first began tampering with SolarWinds\u2019 code as early as October 2019, a few months before it was in a position to launch an attack.\n\nPressure is growing on the White House to act.\n\nRepublican Senator Marco Rubio said \u201cAmerica must retaliate, and not just with sanctions.\u201d Mitt Romney, also a Republican, likened the attack to repeatedly allowing Russian bombers to fly undetected over America. Senator Dick Durbin, a Democrat, has called it \u201cvirtually a declaration of war.\u201d\n\nDemocratic lawmakers said they had received little information from the Trump administration beyond what\u2019s in the media. \u201cTheir briefings were obtuse, sorely lacking in details and really seemed an attempt to provide us with the barest of minimum in information that they had to give us,\u201d Democratic Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz told reporters after a classified briefing.\n\nUllyot, the National Security Council spokesman, declined to comment on the congressional briefings. The White House was \u201cfocused on investigating the circumstances surrounding this incident, and working with our interagency partners to mitigate the situation,\u201d he said in a statement to Reuters.\n\nPresident-elect Joe Biden has warned that his administration would impose \u201csubstantial costs\u201d on those responsible. House of Representatives Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, also a Democrat, said Biden \u201cmust make hardening our networks \u2013 both public and private infrastructure \u2013 a major priority.\u201d\n\nThe attack puts a spotlight on those cyber defenses, reviving criticism that the U.S. intelligence agencies are more interested in offensive cyber operations than protecting government infrastructure.\n\n\u201cThe attacker has the advantage over defenders. Decades worth of money, patents and effort have done nothing to change that,\u201d said Jason Healey, a cyber conflict researcher at Columbia University and former White House security official in the George W. Bush administration.\n\n\u201cNow we learn with the SolarWinds hack that if anything, the defenders are falling farther behind. The overriding priority must be to flip this, so that defenders have the easier time.\u201d", "topic": "business", "tag": "headline", "types": [], "claim": "", "verdict": ""}, {"url": "https://news.yahoo.com/trump-promises-wild-protests-washington-165055313.html", "source": "news.yahoo.com", "authors": ["Sophia Ankel"], "title": "Trump promises 'wild' protests in Washington DC on the day the Electoral College will finalize election results - Yahoo News", "pubDate": "2020-12-20T16:50:00+00:00", "description": "President Trump took to Twitter on Saturday to urge his followers to rally in Washington two weeks before Inauguration Day.", "imageUrl": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/UmRzvaXlxvC7OZji9P_Y0A--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MTc3NzthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/business_insider_articles_888/07d19bc73a5bfbd81cba7cd18a71502a", "language": "en", "country": "us", "content": "\n\u2022 None President Trump urged his supporters to flock to Washington DC on January 6, promising them a \"wild\" rally.\n\u2022 None January 6 is the same day that Congress is scheduled to meet to formally finalize the presidential election results.\n\u2022 None Although not much can legally be done on the date, many pro-Trump Republicans have said they will try to disrupt the process.\n\nRelated: Trump still hasn't conceded \u2014 here's how other runner-ups have\n\nPresident Trump promised his supporters there would be a \"wild\" rally in Washington DC on January 6, the same day that Congress is scheduled to meet to formally finalize the presidential election results.\n\n\"Statistically impossible to have lost the 2020 Election,\" Trump tweeted on Saturday. \"Big protest in DC on January 6th.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump\u2019s administration is ending how it began, with over-the-top declarations of praise for the chief executive.\n\nBut now the flattery is mixed with a sense of finality as key people in the president\u2019s orbit are beginning to turn the page and acknowledge his defeat. Trump himself keeps to the Oval Office, still fighting the Election Day results and offering scant acknowledgement of the death and suffering Americans are bearing in the darkest hours of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn a week when the Electoral College made official President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s victory, Trump remained out of sight, staying late in the Oval Office and working the phones and television remote in his private dining area just steps from the Resolute Desk.\n\nWhile he made not one public appearance, some of those who have been his most influential allies and loyal defenders gave up the fight, letting the president down as gently as possible.\n\nAttorney General William Barr offered his resignation last Monday after weeks of tension with Trump brought about an early exit from his post. Long seen as one of Trump\u2019s most supportive Cabinet members, Barr in recent weeks and months had drawn Trump\u2019s wrath for not supporting the president\u2019s baseless claims of election fraud or for not publicly pursuing an investigation into Biden\u2019s son Hunter.\n\nBut when Barr stepped aside, he did so with flowery language reminiscent of the compliments that were tossed as verbal bouquets at Trump during early Cabinet meetings.\n\n\u201cYour record is all the more historic because you accomplished it in the face of relentless, implacable resistance,\u201d Barr wrote in his resignation letter. Trump promptly tweeted it out, adding his own words of praise for the attorney general.\n\nIn the six weeks since his defeat by Biden, Trump has been increasingly disengaged from his job. The virus has killed more than 300,000 Americans and is now claiming more than 3,000 lives a day, but the president has offered barely a word about the deaths or the development of the vaccine that could bring an end to the pandemic.\n\nAt the same time, he has relentlessly tweeted conspiracy theories and false claims about the election, incorrectly insisting it was stolen from him while taking steps to undermine the Biden administration before it begins. Most Republicans went along, refusing to push Trump to stop or work with the president-elect.\n\nMany in the GOP took their cues from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who refused to stand up to Trump, instead making the calculation that an outraged Republican base \u2014 and an angry president \u2014 could help produce victories in a pair of January runoff races in Georgia that will dictate control of the Senate. But this past week, even McConnell, R-Ky., bent to reality, declaring that the Electoral College \u201chad spoken\u201d and that Biden was the victor.\n\nMcConnell\u2019s acknowledgement that Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris had won came only after a long public recap of Trump\u2019s accomplishments on the Senate floor. McConnell spoke about Trump for nine minutes, declaring that \u201cmany of us hoped that the presidential election would yield a different result.\u201d He discussed Biden for one minute.\n\nSome more of Trump\u2019s fiercest allies also appeared to give credence, albeit briefly, to the electoral result. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said in a cable television appearance that Trump was in strong position for a possible 2024 campaign \u2014 a roundabout acknowledgement that he won\u2019t be president come next year.\n\nOthers close to Trump also marked the looming end. His daughter and adviser Ivanka Trump began with tweeted photos of moments throughout the term. His son Eric Trump and his family posed for photos just outside the Oval Office. West Wing staffers put up photos on Instagram of White House Christmas parties, and most of those pictured weren\u2019t wearing masks.\n\nVice President Mike Pence continued his role as Trump\u2019s biggest hype man, even as the cheerleading came with a whiff of nostalgia. Pence in a ceremony Friday marked the first anniversary of the U.S. Space Force, which he framed as a major part of Trump\u2019s legacy.\n\nBut with Trump largely in hiding, it fell to Pence to make a public show of meeting with those distributing the vaccine. And on Friday, he was the one who rolled up his sleeves and took a public shot in the arm as part of a campaign to convince Americans the vaccine is safe.\n\nTrump has been happy to bask in praise throughout his presidency. His Cabinet meetings at times resembled \u201cDear Leader\u201d sessions in authoritarian nations where officials gush compliments for the man in charge.\n\nThe tone was set at the president\u2019s first Cabinet meeting, in June 2017, when the only subject for debate appeared to whether Trump was a great president or the greatest. With the media invited to watch, Trump extolled the achievements of his young administration, asserting that he had accomplished more than any president in his first six months \u2014 with \u201cfew exceptions,\u201d like President Franklin D. Roosevelt.\n\nPence that day declared his job was \u201cthe greatest privilege of my life.\u201d Attorney General Jeff Sessions said he was \u201cthrilled,\u201d Energy Secretary Rick Perry gave his \u201chats off\u201d to Trump and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross offered thanks \u201cfor the opportunity\u201d to work for the president.\n\nPerhaps the strongest words came from chief of staff Reince Priebus: \u201cOn behalf of the entire senior staff around you, Mr. President, we thank you for the opportunity and the blessing that you\u2019ve given us to serve your agenda.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump convened his 25th and perhaps final Cabinet meeting. Much had changed.\n\nSeveral top officials were not there, including Barr, whose resignation was pending; acting Interior Secretary David Bernhardt, who had tested positive for COVID-19; and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who was quarantining because he had been exposed to someone with the virus.\n\nWhether there was effusive praise of Trump remains unknown.\n\nThe president did not let the media in.", "topic": "general", "tag": "headline", "types": [], "claim": "", "verdict": ""}, {"url": "https://wkow.com/2020/12/20/light-snow-mix-arrives-overnight-into-monday/", "source": "wkow.com", "authors": [], "title": "Light snow, mix arrives overnight into Monday - WKOW", "pubDate": "2020-12-20T13:30:14+00:00", "description": "Partly sunny skies are expected Sunday, it'll be a rather quiet day with high temperatures above average once again.", "imageUrl": "https://quincy-network.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2020/12/future-track-860x484.jpg", "language": "en", "country": "us", "content": "A light snow, mix is expected to arrive to portions of our viewing area overnight Sunday into Monday morning, pushing out of the area around late-morning or early-afternoon depending on location.\n\nThe system will be a quick hitter, with an inch or less accumulation likely.\n\nMonday not only brings precipitation, it is the first official day of winter.

infantilised idea of what a relationship was,\" he said.\n\nSally started a relationship with Richard Challen when she was 15 years old and he was 22.\n\nWhile he never physically assaulted her, Richard soon began an insidious campaign of oppression that domestic violence experts now call coercive control.\n\n\"There was controlling of her finances, controlling her movements, gaslighting her, making her question her sanity, the numerous times he cheated, he made her believe she was making it up in her head,\" Mr Challen said.\n\n\"She had to be home when he was home, dinner had to be on the table, there was abusive language, putting her down, fat-shaming her, manipulating her.\n\nMs Challen spent nine years in prison for killing her husband.\n\nBut her conviction was thrown out last year after new evidence showed that she had been subjected to coercive control, a criminal offence introduced in England and Wales in 2015.\n\nThe law makes it a crime punishable by up to five years in jail to repeatedly make a person in a relationship feel controlled, dependent, isolated or scared.\n\nThat can include isolating someone from loved ones, controlling their finances, monitoring their activities and repeatedly calling someone names.\n\nDavid Challen is adamant if the laws had been in place earlier, the horror would have played out very differently.\n\n\"I guarantee you we would have had a chance to stop it and a chance is all we needed, I would have taken my father to the police, I would have reported him,\" Mr Challen said.\n\nMr Challen spent years advocating for his mother's freedom, saying any sense of resentment towards her for what she had done was \"fleeting.\"\n\n\"Because I understood that she'd had a loss of control, I understood that she had no control over her actions at that moment in time,\" he said.\n\nCoercive control laws may be introduced in Australia\n\nMr Challen is now a campaigner against domestic abuse and has been watching the debate over the introduction of coercive control laws in Australia closely.\n\nCurrently, only Tasmania has laws that seek to respond to coercive and controlling behaviours, but potential changes to domestic violence legislation are also being discussed in New South Wales, Queensland, and Victoria.\n\n\"If we don't give those laws to victims in Australia we are depriving them of that protection and that's a dereliction of duty,\" he said.\n\n\"It is so vital to understand coercive control because it is the foundation of domestic abuse you know, without understanding it we can't hope to tackle it.\"\n\nEngland and Wales have had coercive control laws in place for five years, but only recently has there been a noticeable increase in their use.\n\nAccording to a report by the Office of National Statistics (ONS), there were 24,856 offences of coercive control recorded by police in the year ending March 2020.\n\nThat's up from 16,679 last year.\n\nIn Scotland, 1,700 offences were recorded in the first year after coercive control laws were introduced there in April 2019.\n\nLyndsay Monaghan, a lawyer with the Scottish Women's Rights Centre, said she anecdotally has noticed a steady increase in the number of women coming forward.\n\nShe said there was overall a considerable amount of resources given to Scottish police to ensure they understood the new laws but argues the education needs to be much further reaching.\n\n\"In terms of what can be done and what should be done when you're introducing this type of legislation, it is really important that there is the training and resources put in behind the support services that are helping women,\" she said.\n\nThe fact that 96 per cent of recorded incidents in that first year led to prosecutions showed the legislation works, Detective Superintendent Debra Forrester from Police Scotland told the ABC.\n\n\"Being able to have these stats already really helps us to reinforce that what cops are doing on the front line is really effective and it is making a difference,\" she said.\n\nLeader of the Women's Equality Party Mandu Reid described the rate of domestic abuse in the UK as being at \"epidemic levels\", with more than 2.5 million victims a year, including those subjected to control and coercive behaviour.\n\nShe said Australia must consider the need for public awareness around any coercive control laws that are introduced.\n\n\"I'm talking about [campaigns that help] people to understand behaviours that 20 years ago, we would say 'that's a domestic type of situation, it's none of our business,'\" she said.\n\nMs Reid said there needs to be further training right through the criminal justice system, including among judges.\n\n\"A lot of work and energy has gone into trying to research and make sense of what this is like from the experience and vantage point of victims. I think that actually creates a groundswell of credibility,\" she said.\n\nDavid Challen believes victims also need to understand the vocabulary surrounding coercive abuse or the reporting levels will remain low and lives will be lost.\n\n\"In our family, it was impossible to tell because we didn't have the language, I knew what was happening was wrong but the word 'abuse' just seemed so remote,\" he said of the time leading up to his father's death.\n\n\"It's difficult to spot abuse like that without the terminology.\"\n\nHe said the complexity of the laws should not act as a deterrent to their introduction.\n\n\"These victims deserve to be recognised, they deserve to be helped,\" he said.\n\nSally Challen is now a grandmother after her son James and his partner had a child last year.\n\n\"She's finding her ability to not be compliant anymore and really just make her own decisions, which I think is the most inspiring thing to see.\"", "topic": "business", "tag": "headline", "types": [], "claim": "", "verdict": ""}, {"url": "https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/coronavirus-nsw-double-bay-cafe-northern-beaches-venues-on-covid-alert/news-story/4d8228f60b917f17733033045cabaf54?nk=97814e3e4e31325aa5c7041220f3eeda-1608507419", "source": "dailytelegraph.com.au", "authors": ["Mitchell Van Homrigh"], "title": "Double Bay cafe on latest COVID venue list - Daily Telegraph", "pubDate": "2020-12-20T19:32:54+00:00", "description": "We&#039;re for Sydney", "imageUrl": "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/347351d29abc80b62866780be40cd71d", "language": "en", "country": "au", "content": "A second COVID case has been linked to the Rose of Australia Hotel at Erskineville in Sydney\u2019s inner west.\n\nA number of clusters linked with the Avalon outbreak have been identified, chief health officer Kerry Chant said today.\n\nFive cases have been identified linked with a Turramurra hair salon, and an additional case has been linked with The Rose of Australia pub in Erskineville, Dr Chant said.\n\nNSW health is concerned about incomplete record keeping at both venues, she said.\n\nAged care facilities have been told not to welcome visitors until Wednesday.\n\nHere are some of the latest venue alerts released by NSW Health:", "topic": "business", "tag": "headline", "types": [], "claim": "", "verdict": ""}, {"url": "https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-12-20-looks-like-epic-games-stores-free-holiday-sale-2020-games-list-has-leaked", "source": "eurogamer.net", "authors": ["Vikki Blake"], "title": "Looks like Epic Games Stores' free Holiday Sale 2020 games list has leaked - Eurogamer.net", "pubDate": "2020-12-20T17:33:29+00:00", "description": "Looks like Epic Games Stores' free Holiday Sale 2020 games list has leaked", "imageUrl": "https://d2skuhm0vrry40.cloudfront.net/2020/articles/2020-12-20-17-23/-1608484982950.jpg/EG11/resize/1200x-1/-1608484982950.jpg", "language": "en", "country": "us", "content": "We already knew that The Epic Games Store was primed to give away free games during its Epic Holiday Sale, but now a cheeky tweet has intimated what might be up for grabs across the whole promotion.\n\nYesterday, the freebie was The Long Dark, and today it's Defense Grid 1, which all fit with the tweet's predictions.

Even last week, when...", "imageUrl": "https://destructoid.com/ul/614018-XboxSeriesSdk.jpg", "language": "en", "country": "us", "content": "This thing is so small and quiet you'd think it was a student at the Milford School\n\nOne thing I've noticed with the past few console launches, something that became quite evident the day I preordered my Xbox Series S, is that I no longer feel the excitement I once did when moving into a new generation. Even last week, when I managed to secure an all-digital PS5 just minutes after I swore to stop trying until next year, it didn't push me to jump for joy. I used to jump for joy picking up a new console. I remember being quite giddy standing in line at Walmart to buy the GameCube on a cold November morning.\n\nMaybe it's because the promise of better technology has lead to diminishing returns over the past two console generations. Maybe it's because there are no launch titles for the Xbox Series of consoles or the PS5 that I \"must play now.\" Or maybe, it's because gaming is so prolific now that it's really all about the games rather than the hardware you choose to play them on.\n\nWhatever it is, I do miss the excitement that comes with anticipating a new console. But with my Xbox Series S, that feeling has been replaced by something that might be just as fulfilling: the satisfaction of knowing you bought quality hardware. I love my Series S not because I managed to buy the \"hot new thing\" but because this console is built so goddamn good.\n\nIt's also so much smaller than I thought it would be. This little white box measures 10.8\" long, 5.9\" deep, and 2.5\" tall when positioned on its side. It weighs less than five pounds. You could fit two of these in an Xbox Series X with a few square inches to spare. My current entertainment center is not well suited for multiple systems, so having a Wii U, PS4 Slim, and Switch hooked up to it takes up a decent amount of usable space. Thankfully, the Series S is so small it sits comfortably next to my Wii U. And unlike my PS4 Slim, this thing is quiet.\n\nSetting it up took around five minutes going through the Xbox app on my phone. With everything synced up to my Xbox account, the console scanned my television and showed me which Series S options I can and cannot use. I know this is not a new technology, as some of my fellow writers were quick to explain to me in Slack, but it did teach me more about my television and how to access HDR content on my PS4. Getting 120 fps is out of the question as my TV doesn't support it, but I can experience 4K on video playback and with any games that support it (and yes, some games support 4K on the Series S).\n\nIf you're looking for a console with power, you should probably know what the Series S is packing in its petite body. Here are some of the specs:\n\nIn the past month, I've come to love just how fast the Xbox Series S gets me into my games. Quick Resume is an outstanding feature. For games that support it, it'll get you back into the action in mere seconds rather than having to wait for a game to load. And it does this across multiple titles at once rather than just having a single game in a suspend state. The console itself is quick to start too. If you go the environmentally friendly route with the Energy-Saver mode, it'll take about 22 seconds to start up. If you choose Instant-On, it's around four seconds.\n\nI'm also really digging the redesigned controller. I've always preferred the layout of the Xbox controller over the PlayStation because I have good taste, but the changes here make it even better than before. Particularly, the directional pad has a nice \"clicky\" quality to it, and it's a bit more comfortable to use than my Xbox One controller.\n\nAs of the publishing of this article, I haven't actually bought any games for the console. Instead, I've been diving into Xbox Game Pass. And it's a deep dive because there are years of games and franchises I've missed not being an Xbox owner. Games like Fable III and Halo 4 that were once out of reach are now at my fingertips. I've enjoyed brand new games with the service, like Call of the Sea, and the recent addition of EA Play will help fill the Star Wars gap between seasons of The Mandalorian. At $15, it's pricier than PS Now. But it's cheaper than Gamefly, which is good because, with the Series S and my soon-to-arrive all-digital PS5, I can't rent games anymore.\n\nAnd these games run magnificently. Are most of what I'm playing from the last generation? Sure, but it's nice to have access to these titles without any of the hiccups they might have had on previous consoles. Games optimized for Series S and Series X can be stunning, though that might have more to do with the incredible art direction employed in those titles. There's a good chance in the near future Xbox Game Pass will stream to your computer or television like Stadia or Luna, but until that happens, the Series S is a great jumping-off point to the service.\n\nDepending on what it is you want from your next-gen system, there are a few downsides to consider before buying a Series S. As stated above, it only has 364 GB of useable space built in. If you like to play a lot of AAA games, expect those file sizes to start around 45 GB. Some games, like Final Fantasy XV: Royal Edition and Quantum Break, easily eclipse 100 GB each.\n\nI have Phantasy Star Online 2, Yakuza 0, Planet Coaster: Console Edition, Alan Wake, Minecraft Dungeons, Ori and the Will of the Wisps, and Carrion currently downloaded to my console, which takes up 39% of its usable space. I'm trying to play through each Game Pass title before moving onto the next, but there are some games I'm just not going to delete from the system. PSO2 was a 75 GB download, and there is no way in hell, with data caps, I'm going to go through that again.\n\nI've also repeatedly run into a weird issue with streaming apps like Disney+ and HBO Max. These apps will occasionally drop the picture, and the screen will pop to white and black before continuing on with whatever I'm watching. While enjoying Little Shop of Horrors, the problem persisted for more than a half-hour until it finally ceased. And it does this whether I'm watching something or not. I can just be browsing the app itself and run into this issue. Now that HBO Max is accessible through my smart TV, I don't have to worry about using these video apps anymore. Still, it's an incredibly odd and ruthlessly persistent problem.\n\nI've seen some speculation that Microsoft might have made too many cuts to the Xbox Series S to actually hang around this entire console generation. I don't know if that's true, but if this does end up being something of a \"transitional console,\" I'm perfectly fine with that. Because it's giving me exactly what I want from it right now: it's an easy gateway to those games I missed in past generations, it's whisper silent, it's tiny enough to fit nicely into my current television stand, and it's letting me play all the new games, just without the Series X bells and whistles.\n\nThere's really not much more that I could ask for here, other than some worthwhile, first-party titles. Those will come eventually, but until they do, I have three generations of games to keep me busy. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to download Phantom Dust.", "topic": "tech", "tag": "headline", "types": [], "claim": "", "verdict": ""}, {"url": "https://www.gematsu.com/2020/12/the-quintessential-quintuplets-summer-memories-also-come-in-five-announced-for-ps4-switch", "source": "gematsu.com", "authors": [], "title": "The Quintessential Quintuplets \u222c: Summer Memories Also Come in Five announced for PS4, Switch [Update] - Gematsu", "pubDate": "2020-12-20T13:33:40+00:00", "description": "Mages. has announced \"heart-pounding deserted island life with quintuplets adventure\" game Gotoubun no Hanayome \u00e2\u0088\u00ac: Natsu no Omoide mo Gotoubun (The\u2026", "imageUrl": "https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Quintessential-Quintuplets_12-20-20.jpg", "language": "en", "country": "us", "content": "Mages. has announced \u00e2\u0080\u009cheart-pounding deserted island life with quintuplets adventure\u00e2\u0080\u009d game Gotoubun no Hanayome \u00e2\u0088\u00ac: Natsu no Omoide mo Gotoubun (The Quintessential Quintuplets \u00e2\u0088\u00ac: Summer Memories Also Come in Five) for PlayStation 4 and Switch.

This was in the face of Nintendo and Sega\u2019s bitter hot rivalry before the turn of the century.\n\nThe rivalry was a defining one in the history of video games. Akin to Sony and Microsoft\u2019s competition in the modern age, the two were the major players in the console space before the PlayStation launched and changed everything. Debates about which company reigned supreme were always hotly contested.\n\nWhile there likely isn\u2019t a name tied as closely to Nintendo as Miyamoto\u2019s, that competition apparently even raged under his own roof. Speaking to The New Yorker, the developer revealed that his kids were players of Sega\u2019s games.\n\nSpeaking about his children, he said: \u201cThey played a lot of Sega games, too, by the way.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if that made him at all envious, the developer said, \u201cNot jealous so much as inspired to try harder, so that they preferred the ones I made.\u201d\n\nWhen asked specifically what games they played, he revealed, \u201cThey liked driving games. Out Run. They also played a lot of Space Harrier.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s great that Miyamoto saw this as a reason to push his own game design. Also, in 2020, it\u2019s not hard to say that Nintendo did end up winning that particular \u2018console war.\u2019\n\nEalier this year, it was revealed that Nintendo and Miyamoto take home far less money than other video game executives.", "topic": "tech", "tag": "headline", "types": [], "claim": "", "verdict": ""}, {"url": "https://gamerant.com/cyberpunk-2077-memes-funny/", "source": "gamerant.com", "authors": ["Sam Cook"], "title": "10 Cyberpunk 2077 Memes That Made Our Ocular Implants Leak From Laughing - GameRant", "pubDate": "2020-12-19T20:25:00+00:00", "description": "From launch bugs to hilarious story moments, Cyberpunk 2077 is an excellent source of meme material for the internet to enjoy.", "imageUrl": "https://static1.gamerantimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Cyberpunk-2077-memes-implants-feature.jpg", "language": "en", "country": "ca", "content": "After the long-awaited release of Cyberpunk 2077, the player reaction has been mixed at best. Fans have shared opinions that range from complimenting how beautiful the world of the game is all the way to complaining that the PS4 version was so utterly incomplete that Sony removed it from their storefront. Other developers like Bethesda have seen their fair share of buggy releases, but this is a rare occurrence.\n\nRELATED: 10 Hilarious The Mandalorian Memes Only True Fans Will Understand\n\nAs you likely know, however, when the internet gets angry at something they were expecting to love, there will be a heck of a lot of memes. While not all of the best memes are complaints, a good number of them are. Either way, these memes are sure to hit hard if you've been fighting your way through Night City!\n\nOne of the more talked about aspects of Cyberpunk's launch has been the wildly different graphics seen between versions of the game. The PC version has been noted as looking incredibly nice (even if the latest hardware still struggles to hit consistent frame rates), though console versions have been notably worse. This meme is a great representation of how it feels.\n\nThis is the kind of expectation vs. reality that you may have from a fast food advertisement, much less a game as hyped as this. The developers say they are working hard to patch these issues away, but many fans are skeptical it can even be done at this point.\n\nThe Most Difficult Choice In Cyberpunk\n\nIn an early quest, players will have to make the most difficult story choice in all of Cyberpunk 2077. \"Was Angel or Skye the girl's name?\" This meme feels light in comparison to some of the more pointedly critical ones on this list. It shows that despite the issues, players are still having an incredibly fun experience they can poke fun at. At least until they play long enough to be surrounded by 20 t-posing cops that teleported behind them. It is not a matter of if, but when!\n\nAnother aspect of the game players have been poking fun about is the way the main character, V, sleeps in bed. They kind of just flop over and lay perpendicular to the direction you would expect someone to sleep. As you can see from this meme, in at least one alternate timeline V is a very good boy who plays with their good friend Johnny Silverpaw. Seems a lot less bleak than the story we got!\n\nBut real talk, this would such a terribly painful way to sleep. You'd never get comfortable, and just imagine the charley horses!\n\nTruly The Most Customizable Game Ever\n\nIf you had been keeping up with the hype surrounding Cyberpunk 2077, you probably would assume that it was this holy grail of customization in an RPG. The reality is, however, that is not quite the case here. This meme points out one of the things players felt incredibly confused to learn after hopping into the game. Of all the things you can change and upgrade, your haircut is simply not one of them.\n\nTo many players, this meme is highlighting a feature that seems so basic and normal to include in an RPG is just not included. They have voiced that they feel more than a little deceived by the hype train.\n\nThis one may go over your head if you don't look too closely. For those out of the loop, those are not the developers of Cyberpunk 2077, but you likely remember the game they did develop. Does No Man's Sky ring a bell? This meme is showing that players are comparing the state of Cyberpunk 2077 at launch to No Man's Sky, which is not great for the developers.\n\nNo Man's Sky released to generally negative reviews in 2016. Fans felt the game was a hollow shell of what they were promised and it has only been recently that patches have brought the game to close to what was promised. Here is hoping Cyberpunk can be a little quicker!\n\nWhat you are witnessing in this meme is the coalescence of a few different trends. Since it was announced it would be an option, fans have been excitedly discussing the option to customize your genitals in the game. Now that the game is out it turns out there are actually very few customization options. Not to mention, your character has underpants grafted to their flesh in-game.\n\nCouple this underwhelming, ahem, feature with the overall distaste for the current state of the game. That recipe for disaster leads to memes like this where players assume the developers were joyless while making the game.\n\nJust Let It Go To Voicemail\n\nIf you have played Cyberpunk 2077 for five minutes then you have likely already received 50 text messages from Regina Jones. Jones is one of the Fixers in Night City, regional crime bosses you encounter. Unlike some of the others, Jones has a few more missions than the other fixers. This is fine because content is content, but maybe finish your first phone call before starting another one. Okay, lady?\n\nThat said, she does lead you to a number of different boss fights around the city that can be fairly fun. So, she's not all bad!\n\nNow, this meme serves as a bit of meta-commentary on the fan reactions to the game's launch. Much of the initial conversation saw players arguing a few key points. One of these was that the game had to have been rushed due to fan demand. While this is something that likely played some role, it is not the only force at play.\n\nRELATED: 10 Funniest Devil May Cry Memes From The Entire Series\n\nMany fans seem to forget that AAA game developers are a business, first and foremost. Holiday shopping is big for game sales and leads many to wonder what their priorities were. Maybe not the best decision in hindsight.\n\n\"What Do You Mean? I Haven't Had A Single Bug!\"\n\nOne of the comments that have led to flame wars online has been to say you have had zero issues with Cyberpunk 2077. Sure enough, someone will come out to share their horror stories and dissatisfaction. This meme, however, suggests that the bugs must just be overflowing into the real world for those lucky few.\n\nOne of the most immersion-breaking bugs in Cyberpunk is exactly what is going on in this meme. Characters are constantly floating in unnatural positions and t-posing around. It isn't as bad as some of the more game-breaking bugs, but it isn't what most people signed up for.\n\nSeriously, Even Just A Hot Fix?\n\nThis meme is poking fun at the way fans have reacted to Cyberpunk 2077. Despite the glitches, broken promises, poor optimization, borderline-false-advertising-on-current-gen-consoles, and numerous flaws overall, players are still desperately waiting for patches. The game must be doing something right if so many people clamor for each and every piece of news on updates.\n\nIf this goes anything like what happened with No Man's Sky, players will be waiting for quite some time before they feel these errors were rectified. Until then, fans will still be able to meme to their heart's content.\n\nNEXT: 10 PS5 & Xbox Series X Memes About Shipping That Make Us Cry Laughing", "topic": "tech", "tag": "headline", "types": [], "claim": "", "verdict": ""}, {"url": "https://driving.ca/chevrolet/features/feature-story/generation-gap-ranking-each-and-every-chevrolet-camaro", "source": "driving.ca", "authors": ["Benjamin Hunting"], "title": "Generation Gap: Ranking each and every Chevrolet Camaro - Driving", "pubDate": "2020-12-20T11:52:00+00:00", "description": "Chevy's muscle car has certainly had its share of ups and downs", "imageUrl": "https://smartcdn.prod.postmedia.digital/driving/images?url=https://smartcdn.prod.postmedia.digital/driving/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/1969-chevrolet-camaro-sport-coupe.jpg&w=600&h=315", "language": "en", "country": "ca", "content": "The Chevrolet Camaro has had a long and distinguished history as one of the pillars of the American muscle car scene.\n\nFrom its auspicious late-\u201960s debut to its recent turn as a startlingly competent, well-rounded sports car, the Camaro has lived many lives and embodied the best and worst of its automotive eras.\n\nAny high-performance automobile that stretches from golden age; to malaise; to rad; to modern is going to attract spirited debate about which versions of the car were the most important, and memorable, to enthusiasts. Check out our take on ranking each and every generation of the Chevrolet Camaro from first to worst.\n\nIt\u2019s not always the case, but when it comes to the Camaro, the first is still the best. The original coupe and convertible made it to market as a reaction to the success of the Ford Mustang, yet it\u2019s hard not to argue that Chevrolet\u2019s own pony car went harder in terms of performance, offering a range of small-block and big-block V8 engines right out of the gate.\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that you could order an affordable six-cylinder version of the Camaro, it\u2019s the Z/28, the Rally Sport, and the SS that rumble nostalgic boulevards with generous V8 power. The Z/28 was particularly memorable for its suspension upgrades, intended to homologate the car for SCCA racing, while straight-line fans could lust over the ultra-rare COPO with its 427-cubic-inch engines ranging from the 425 horsepower L72 to the all-aluminum 430-horsepower ZL-1. The latter went on to become a legend in the Camaro community and make its mark on far-future generations of the car.\n\nWhy does the fourth-generation Chevrolet Camaro take the second spot in our ranking? Its styling might be controversial, and its interiors overly plasticky, but to our minds it\u2019s the 1993-2002 edition of the car that re-established the Camaro as a force to be reckoned with on the streets.\n\nThe introduction of the 5.7L LT1 engine brought 275 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque to the party, and by the end of the decade, the LS1 was offering up 305 horses. Each of these drivetrains was more than a match for the Mustang GT of the era, and even nipped at the heels of the much more expensive Corvette.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t even take into account special models like the 30th Anniversary cars with their 330 horsepower, 5.7L LT4 engines. It was a triumphant return for the SS trim, and while the Camaro might have gone on an extended hiatus following the 2002 model year, it definitely left the muscle car scene a champion.\n\nThe 2010 Camaro debuted to major excitement by muscle car fans intrigued by its design callbacks to the first-generation cars, combined with the exceptional performance offered by its range of large-displacement V8 engines. Once again Chevrolet was in the driver\u2019s seat when compared against the Mustang in terms of power, with 426 horses available from the 6.2L V8 in the SS.\n\nThe Mustang eventually caught up, but the Camaro surged forward with the track-ready 1LE suspension and aero package, the supercharged 480-horsepower ZL1, and the radical 7.0L 505-horsepower modern interpretation of the Z/28, which featured unique DSSV shock absorber setup cribbed from the world of Formula One racing. Sure, it wasn\u2019t easy to see out of, but you could rest easy knowing that other muscle car owners were safely in the rear view.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that the third-generation Chevrolet Camaro has become a styling icon, being seen today as a shining light of Rad-era design done right. Unfortunately, when it first hit the scene, its drivetrains were still emerging from the smog-choked dark ages, which means a host of sub-150-horsepower V8s and even sadder four-cylinder and V6 options.\n\nTime heals many automotive wounds, however, and towards the end of its run a mightier 5.7L engine with 245 horsepower made it the equal of the Fox-body Mustang that was its most common foe in the stoplight grand prix. A rare convertible option provided the first drop-top Camaro in decades when it debuted in 1987, while the IROC-Z trim level and the 1LE race-ready package both celebrated the return of the coupe to motorsports competition.\n\nThere\u2019s technically nothing wrong with the current iteration of the Camaro. Indeed, the sixth generation carries forward much of its predecessor\u2019s power and handling capabilities, and also makes a turbocharged four-cylinder model available for the very first time.\n\nAnd yet, there\u2019s something lacking from this Camaro\u2019s personality versus models of old. Perhaps it\u2019s the more anonymous styling, or the even higher door sills and gun-slit windows that make the driver a prisoner inside its cabin.\n\nWhatever the reason, despite offering the most powerful V8s (455 horses for the SS; 650 supercharged ponies for the ZL1) in Camaro history, and the best chassis ever offered by a production muscle car, Chevrolet\u2019s coupe and convertible pairing have seen sales dwindle compared to rivals like the Ford Mustang and the Dodge Challenger.\n\nLike many muscle machines of the early \u201970s, the second-generation Camaro started out strong and then faded quickly into humiliation. A dramatic update of the original car\u2019s platform, models like the Z/28 offered fastback styling and strong performance starting in 1970, but by the second model year, engine output was already beginning to sag under the effects of reduced compression and increased emissions equipment.\n\nStyling underwent a major shift in 1974 and the Camaro continued to get thirstier and slower with each passing of the seasons. Vehicle weights were up, too, reducing much of the sporty handling that had been a hallmark of the Z/28. By 1975 that trim level had disappeared, only to re-emerge in 1977 as its own unique model, equipped with a paltry 185-horsepower 350-cubic-inch engine.\n\nThe end of the decade saw the once-mighty Camaro reduced to caricature and function-free sticker packages and leaky T-tops, but sales were strong throughout the entire decade as hundreds of thousands of buyers tried to hang on to their memories of the coupe\u2019s golden years.", "topic": "tech", "tag": "headline", "types": [], "claim": "", "verdict": ""}, {"url": "https://www.thegamer.com/cyberpunk-2077-warning-xbox-store/", "source": "thegamer.com", "authors": ["Joshua Robertson"], "title": "Cyberpunk 2077 Now Has A Warning On Its Xbox Store Page - TheGamer", "pubDate": "2020-12-19T18:55:00+00:00", "description": "Microsoft has added a performance warning to Cyberpunk 2077's Xbox store page.", "imageUrl": "https://static0.thegamerimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Cyberpunk-2077-Xbox-Warning.jpg", "language": "en", "country": "ca", "content": "A warning has been added to the Microsoft store page for Cyberpunk 2077 following the game's disastrous launch.\n\nThe public reception to Cyberpunk 2077 on last-gen base consoles is less than ideal. The news has recently been dominated by dissatisfied customers, refund demands, and glitch compilations. It all came to a head last Friday when Sony pulled Cyberpunk 2077 from the PlayStation store and issued refunds to every customer that wanted one, an unprecedented move for a game with this level of hype and financial backing.\n\nRelated: Cyberpunk 2077 Isn't The First Game To Launch In A Broken State, But It's The Worst Offender Yet\n\nMost people then started to wonder if Microsoft would eventually follow Sony and remove Cyberpunk 2077 from the Microsoft store. However, the recent addition of a warning to the game's store page indicates that Microsoft is likely going to keep the game available for purchase on its digital storefront, although with a big disclaimer making sure potential buyers are aware of the game's poor state at the moment.\n\nThis news comes after Microsoft publicly announced on its Xbox Support Twitter account that it would also be issuing refunds to anyone who has purchased the game digitally. Microsoft also goes on to explain that it understands how much effort has gone into the launch of Cybepunk 2077 but has been forced into offering refunds due to the sheer volume of dissatisfied customers asking for them.\n\nCD Projekt Red has also announced that it will be assisting with the refunds of physical copies until December 21st if buyers can't get refunds from the outlets they bought the game from. The public reception to the refunds and Sony pulling the game entirely has been mixed, with some applauding the companies and others labeling Sony as anti-consumer for not allowing PlayStation owners to buy the game.\n\nThere is currently no date scheduled for Cyberpunk 2077's return to the PlayStation storefront, but there are patches scheduled for release in January and February next year that will hopefully get the game in a playable condition. For the time being, if you want a refund you'll need to contact Microsoft or Sony and contact CD Projekt Red directly by December 21st if you need a refund for a physical copy.\n\nNext: Critics Aren't Lying To You", "topic": "tech", "tag": "headline", "types": [], "claim": "", "verdict": ""}, {"url": "https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/covid-19-causing-kiwis-change-christmas-shopping-habits-survey-reveals", "source": "tvnz.co.nz", "authors": [], "title": "Covid-19 causing Kiwis to change Christmas shopping habits, survey reveals - 1News", "pubDate": "2020-12-20T05:41:47+00:00", "description": "Despite the pandemic, Kiwis are still getting in the spirit in 2020.", "imageUrl": "https://news-image-prod-imgix.tech.tvnz.co.nz/content/dam/images/news/2020/12/20/survey-reveals-covid-19-causing-kiwis-to-change-christmas-shoppi.hashed.d8296ea3.desktop.story.share.jpg", "language": "en", "country": "nz", "content": "Buying locally and decisively \u2014 that's the way many New Zealanders are preparing for Christmas this year, a recent shopping trend survey has revealed.\n\nThe findings said Covid-19 has effected Christmas shopping habits \u2013 data people like Rebecca Baylis, director at Hatch Baby and Child, are seeing.\n\n\u201cWe are finding that our pedestrian count is down a lot.

Photo / Getty Images\n\nBeijing's monster fishing fleet has long since stripped its own waters bare. Now it is aggressively prowling the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans for a catch. And it is coming to Australia.\n\nIt grabs as much as it can. As fast as it can. Wherever it can. Not that there is anything entirely unusual about this.\n\nWhat makes China's fishing fleet different, however, is that the Communist Party officially sanctions its behaviour. It is organised and overseen by the Communist Party. And it's used to assert the territorial ambitions of the Communist Party.\n\n\"Helmsman\" Xi Jinping \u2013 who recently adopted the honorific reserved for founder Mao Zedong \u2013 has urged his nation to \"build bigger ships and venture even farther into the oceans and catch bigger fish\".\n\nIt's now the world's largest fleet. Its operations span the globe. One count places the number of deepwater vessels at its disposal at 12,500.\n\nBut the full extent of its operations came to light earlier this year when Global Fishing Watch released a study based on satellite data and tracking analysis.\n\nWhatever the number, the fleet has another use \u2013 diplomatic bludgeon.\n\nAnd Australia is currently Beijing's No. 1 whipping boy.\n\nAustralia's rock lobster industry is just one of many targets of Beijing's punitive economic acts. Now Australia's fishers are worried Beijing's fishing fleet may come for them: The site of a proposed new $218 million Chinese port is right in the middle of the Torres Strait rock lobster fishery.\n\nForeign Minister Marise Payne was quick to reassure that Border Force vessels would monitor the region to enforce territorial boundaries and joint-fishing treaties.\n\nBut if China claims the Papua New Guinea port gives it access to Australia's fisheries, that could cause problems.\n\nFormer government foreign policy advisor Philip Citowicki says the proposed port is a demonstration of great-power wedge politics.\n\n\"The reality is that it continues to seat PNG at the centre of a tug of war, where the presence of China's authoritarianism is increasingly imprinting itself on the fledgling democracies of the Pacific,\" he writes.\n\n\"Rarely driven by altruism or regional responsibility, it places both the resources and security of the region at risk.\"\n\nIt's not a new threat.\n\nIn 2018, the Lowy Institute foresaw Beijing's fleet \"may soon create new security headaches for Australia\".\n\n\"The impact of Chinese fishing has important strategic consequences for Australia's region in several ways,\" David Brewster wrote at the time.\n\n\"There is a good chance that fishing will become a key locus of disputes and incidents involving China.\"\n\nChile's navy is on alert. China's fishing fleet is currently off its shores. Some 400 vessels are operating in international waters. The Chilean navy says 11 have so far crossed into its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).\n\nThe unfolding drama is following a well-established pattern.\n\nChina's Ecuadorean embassy insists Beijing has a \"zero tolerance\" policy towards illegal fishing, yet few complaints are followed up. Fewer still are upheld.\n\nCentre for International Maritime Security (CIMSEC) Indo-Pacific analyst Blake Herzinger says international governments are starting to wake up to the damage done.\n\n\"Globally, economic losses from illegal fishing are difficult to quantify, but there is little disagreement that the overall economic loss totals tens of billions of dollars yearly, encompassing lost tax revenue, onshore fishing industry jobs, and depletion of food supplies,\" he writes.\n\nThe small South American nations of Chile, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru are worried their fisheries are in the process of being looted.\n\nIn November they issued a joint statement asserting they would combine their limited resources \"to prevent, discourage and jointly confront\" any illegal fishing operations.\n\nThey did not name China. But the presence of so many of China's large, modern fishing vessels off their shores is hard to miss.\n\nAnd this particular fleet has been the focus of world attention since July when it was caught within the international marine reserve surrounding Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.\n\nEcuador doesn't have the strength to enforce international law. And its government is heavily indebted to Beijing and struggling to pay back infrastructure loans.\n\nBeijing's fishing fleet is not just a commercial operation. It is a party-political one.\n\nIt is organised as a militia. Key factory ships have Communist Party commissars watching over the captains and their operations. Selected crews are trained to work in concert with the People's Liberation Army Navy.\n\nIn return, Beijing pays its fuel bill \u2013 the fishing fleet's single greatest expense. It's a massive subsidy that allows it to undercut its international competitors significantly.\n\nSome vessels do no fishing at all. Instead, their job is to monitor the active fleet, intimidate fishers of other nations, or simply sit provocatively inside another nation's territory.\n\nThis makes them a diplomatic weapon, part of Beijing's determination to wage \"hybrid war\" \u2013 the use of every means available short of kinetic weaponry \u2013 to assert its will.\n\nThey've recently been highly visible off the Philippines and Indonesia.\n\nWherever the fleet goes, armed coast guard ships usually follow \u2013 no matter how far from China's coast the fleet may be. And China's coast guard is not a civilian police force. The People's Liberation Army operates it. And that dramatically escalates the implications of any confrontation.\n\nHerzinger says international fishing regulations are being enforced \u2013 but only against weaker nations such as Cambodia, Thailand, the Philippines and Vietnam.\n\nChina escapes criticism because of the power of its potential economic and at-sea backlash.\n\nThe CIMSEC analyst argues the best response would be international sanctions:\n\n\"Shipbuilders, exporters, fish processing, and equipment manufacturers supporting China's distant water fishing fleet should all be considered within the realm of possibility for sanction,\" he writes.\n\n\"The prospect of collapse for a primary source of protein for more than 10 per cent of the world's population is worthy of attention.\"\n\nChina's 1.4 billion people love seafood \u2013 each reportedly consuming an average of 37.8kg a year. That's some 38 per cent of the total annual worldwide catch.\n\nBut Beijing's fishing fleet also sells huge quantities to markets such as the US, Europe and Australia.\n\nExactly how much it takes from the oceans is unknown. The militia does not report its catch to international authorities. Only the Communist Party gets that data.\n\nIt has a history, though.\n\nChina's coastal waters have been fished to the point of destruction. Studies suggest only 15 per cent of the region's pre-1980s fish population survives. And yet, some 300,000 coastal fishing vessels continue to chase them down.\n\nAnd the destruction of crucial South China Sea spawning grounds through their conversion into artificial island fortresses hasn't helped the prospects of recovery.\n\nChina's politically-controlled fleet is now operational worldwide. It also can be found among European and African vessels in the Atlantic Ocean off northwest Africa.\n\nBut it's not just China.\n\nThe UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation estimates 90 per cent of global commercial fish stocks are depleted. Now climate change is destroying environments, and \"dead zones\" of oxygen-depleted waters are expanding in the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal.\n\nUp to one-third of the seafood catch imported into the US has been found to have inadequate documentation \u2013 indicating it has been illegally caught.\n\n\"Much of that illegal catch comes from the exclusive economic zones of states such as Guinea, the Philippines, and North Korea that are impoverished and cannot exercise sufficient control of their maritime areas,\" Herzinger says.\n\nBeijing insists its fleets are innocent. And, besides, its wolf-warrior diplomats declare, the entire international fishing system is both chaotic and corrupt.

The huge amount of contrast, sharpening and noise reduction can sometimes leave you with a pulp of an image \u2013 especially if you attempt to edit them. However, ProRaw from Apple may end up being a huge leap forward.\n\nA recent video from Moment (above) compares the results with ProRaw versus standard JPEGs from the latest iPhone 12 Pro cameras. Using a tripod to closely match each scene, Moment takes a number of images with both formats \u2013 with the great thing about the iPhone user interface being how straight forward it is to switch between the two image types.\n\nIt's probably unlikely that you'll be able to see a clear difference between the images on a smartphone screen; however, on a larger more professional screen, there seem to be some distinct differences.\n\nThe results from ProRaw are definitely more pleasing to look at, and lack the over-processed look. JPEGs from the iPhone have a comparatively harsh, 'chunky' look to them, which is due to the extreme amount of contrast and sharpening being baked in. The ProRaw files, however, look like they were taken with a 'proper' camera.\n\nThe colors from the ProRaw files are more pleasing to look at, and they seem to transition better as well. The biggest difference, though, is that details look clearer and more natural.\n\nIt's definitely interesting to see how this could impact the photography industry.

The arrival of 2G came with text messages, the launch of 3G unlocked data services, and the arrival of 4G made the mobile Internet a practical reality.\n\n5G is no different, serving up gigabit speeds, greater capacity, and ultra-low latency. This means it will be easier to stream video, get a signal in busy locations and indoors, and entirely new business and consumer applications will be possible.\n\nThe first 5G networks went live in the UK in 2019 and one billion people will have access globally by the end of 2020. Within five years, four in ten connections will be 5G.\n\nDevelopment of 5G is ongoing, but for some attention has already turned to the next next big thing. Unsurprisingly, that's expected to be called 6G and we've put together the below guide to introduce you to what we expect it to be.\n\n6G \u2013 as the name suggests \u2013 is the sixth generation of mobile connectivity. It\u2019s still unclear what final form 6G will take until it is standardized, but it isn\u2019t too early to speculate which technologies will be included and which characteristics it will have.\n\nWhat is apparent is that 5G will benefit from the backend changes made to mobile networks to power 5G. Operators have densified radio networks with more antennas so its easier to get a signal, especially indoors, while cloud technologies and edge computing mean data can be processed closer to users \u2013 even at a mast level so latency is much lower.\n\n6G will build on this foundation and introduce new capabilities far beyond the limits of 5G.\n\nHow is 6G different from 5G?\n\nThe most obvious difference is speed. 6G will use more advanced radio equipment and a greater volume and diversity of airwaves than 5G, including the use of Extreme High Frequency (EHF) spectrum that delivers ultra-high speeds and huge capacity over short distances.\n\nWhereas 4G speeds were talked about in megabit terms, and 5G will push the gigabit barrier, 6G will deliver theoretical terabit speeds. Most users will get in excess of 100Gbps, but this is still a transformational bitrate.\n\nIn terms of coverage, 6G could become ubiquitous. 6G satellite technology and intelligent surfaces capable of reflecting electromagnetic signals will deliver low latency, multi-gigabit connectivity to parts of the world where it has been too difficult or too expensive to reach with conventional mobile networks. Remote parts of the globe, the skies, and the oceans could all be connected.\n\nWhile 5G already harnesses AI for optimization, dynamic resource allocation, and for data processing, extreme-low latency of less than one millisecond and distributed architecture means 6G will be able to deliver ubiquitous, integrated intelligence. Indeed, Japanese operator NTT DoCoMo believes 6G will allow for AI that is analogous to the human brain.\n\n6G will also be more efficient than its predecessor and consume less power. Energy efficiency is critical for a more sustainable mobile industry because of the anticipated growth in data generation.\n\nWhat will 6G be able to do?\n\nFaster speeds, greater capacity, and lower latency will free applications from the constraints of local processing power, connect more devices to the network, and blur the lines between the physical, human and digital worlds. Existing services will be transformed but 6G could be the network that finally delivers use cases from the realms of science fiction.\n\nTerabit speeds will inevitably make Netflix a more enjoyable experience and FaceTime calls less painful, but ubiquitous coverage and more connected \u2018things\u2019 will change the way we interact with technology \u2013 and potentially the world itself.\n\n6G will enable location and context-aware digital services, as well as sensory experiences such as truly immersive extended reality (XR) and high-fidelity holograms. Instead of Zoom calls, it will be possible to speak to people in real time in VR, using wearable sensors, so users have the physical sensation of being in the same room together.\n\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) will expand and become more advanced, providing applications with more data and more capabilities. Real-time AI could transform robotics, while the extension of 6G coverage to the seas and skies could aid connected maritime, aviation and even space applications.\n\nAnd because 6G is so much more power efficient than 5G, it may be even possible for low-power IoT devices to be charged over the network \u2013 transforming the economics of mass deployments and aiding sustainability.\n\nGiven the rise of mobile connectivity as a geopolitical battleground, it\u2019s no surprise that governments around the world are keen for their countries to be leaders in the nascent field of 6G development.\n\nThere are a number of privately and publicly funded research projects taking place around the world, one of the most notable of which is the \u20ac251m \u20186Genesis\u2019 project in Oulu, Northern Finland \u2013 a location that has long been associated with the developments of mobile networks.\n\nChina\u2019s research efforts have already seen it launch a 6G satellite into space, while Samsung and Nokia are leading efforts in South Korea and Europe. The UK\u2019s principal project is at the 6G Innovation Centre (6GIC) at the University of Surrey.\n\nWhen will 6G be available?\n\nDevelopment is still at a very early stage and a final release will depend on the pace of rollout and a consensus on the technologies that eventually comprise the final standard.\n\nSamsung believes commercial 6G services could be available as early as 2028, but it could be 2030 before the first site is switched on. Don't expect to see that small 6G logo appear on your phone for a long time.\n\nJust as 4G and 5G will coexist for some time (they share the same core network), it is likely that 6G and 5G will work together for some time. Development of 5G technology still has a long way to go and the 6GIC believes 5G has a 20-year lifespan, meaning it is likely to be around until at least 2040.\n\u2022 Everything you need to know about 5G", "topic": "tech", "tag": "headline", "types": [], "claim": "", "verdict": ""}, {"url": "https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/cloudpunk-is-an-exceptional-cyberpunk-game-that-keeps-getting-better/", "source": "pcgamer.com", "authors": ["Fraser Brown"], "title": "Cloudpunk is an exceptional cyberpunk game that keeps getting better - PC Gamer", "pubDate": "2020-12-20T11:01:00+00:00", "description": "Cloudpunk&apos;s transformation has been a pleasure to watch.

She's frequently stunned by it, but also very critical. It's an incredible place that also happens to be deeply fucked up and broken.\n\nSo yeah, it was fantastic. Then the first-person mode appeared, initially for the on-foot sections. Previously, these were presented side-on with a fixed camera, and while the ability to explore the city outside of the car was very welcome, I always found myself aching to return to my boxy, banged-up vehicle. The first-person mode changed that straight away. Walking around became a delight. Wizardry must have been involved. The game wasn't designed with a first-person perspective in mind, but it works so damn well. Now I can't imagine playing it any other way. And it only took Ion Lands a month to implement. As I said: wizardry.\n\nViewing the city up close really lets you admire the impressive voxel art and so many little details that were hard to pick out when it kept you at a distance. It's so much larger and intimidating and lively, but simultaneously intimate. An unlocked third-person camera was also added, and most recently a first-person driving mode, letting you experience the whole game from Rainia's eyes. It's the best way to see the city, but I'm just as enamoured with the inside of my car, which includes a diegetic display that puts your fuel meter, bank balance, minimap and other helpful details on the dashboard.\n\nCloudpunk could have just let me fly my car around a weird city in the distant future and I would have absolutely been content, but it reeled me in with its intriguing, understated story and then catapulted itself to the top of my favourite games list thanks to the extra attention it's received from Ion Lands.

The game beat out Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, which was in second place after managing to sell as many copies this past week as it did the week before. It is the first time the Black Ops sub-series has not managed to claim Christmas No.1.\n\nThe big No.1 of last week was Cyberpunk 2077, and the RPG dropped 80% in sales this week and falls to No.3. The game has received some extremely negative press in recent days due to its poor technical performance on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. However, it's worth noting that an 80% drop in sales is not hugely unusual for a game such as this. Indeed, other games that secured big pre-orders, like The Last of Us: Part Two in the summer, and Assassin's Creed Valhalla in November, both dropped by 80% and 70% respectively in their second week.\n\nIt's likely the negative press has had some impact upon the game's sales this week, but the majority of the decline is to be expected.\n\nCD Projekt's new game does hold off FIFA 21, which has to settle for fourth place despite a 40% sales increased. Meanwhile, Animal Crossing: New Horizons is at No.5 with an 11% drop in sales, the first sales drop it's experienced in over a month. Just 9,000 units separates Animal Crossing at No.5 and Assassin's Creed Valhalla at No.1.\n\nThis entire chart is purely based on physical retail sales.\n\nElsewhere, there were a number of last minute spikes in sales across the charts, partially due to price discounting. Spider-Man: Miles Morales climbs to No.6 after a 45% sales rise, Ring Fit Adventure returns to the Top Ten at No.9 after an 155% sales jump and Super Mario 3D All-Stars holds tenth spot with a 44% sales increase. Outside of the Top Ten, Immortals: Fenyx Rising jumps to No.12 thanks to an 107% sales increase, Watch Dogs Legion is at No.14 due to a 98% sales spike, and Carnival Games returns at No.35 with a 499% sales surge. There were deals on PS4 games, too, which meant that The Last of Us: Part Two is back at No.30 with a 374|% sales spike, and Ghost of Tsushima reaches No.34 after sales rose 208%.\n\nHere is the Christmas GfK Top Ten for the week ending December 19th:\n\nAnd just for fun, here are all the other Christmas No.1s in history.

So, until now, we have now seen individuals singing Christmas carols and vacation songs. Well, that was not the concept when Google created Blob Opera.\n\nInstead of creating individuals sing comforting operatic songs, the Blob Opera makes 4 multi-colored blobs (sure, blobs!) sing like the professionals. You can drag them up and down, ahead and backward to alter the pitch and the vowel sounds respectively to create your individual festive music.\n\nThis interactive opera is an experimental mission by David Li in collaboration with Google Arts & Culture. It basically helps you to create a festive music from scratch and document it to share with the world. Moreover, you possibly can select from an array of pre-loaded songs to make the lovable blobs sing in sync with one another.\n\nHow Does it Work?\n\nNow, stepping into technicalities, these colourful creatures are powered by a machine studying mannequin. Google developed this AI-powered mannequin based mostly on 16 hours of singing by 4 skilled opera singers \u2013 Christian Joel (Tenor), Frederick Tong (Bass), Joanne Gamble (Mezzo-soprano), and Olivia Doutney (Soprano).\n\nSo, the mannequin makes use of the data it gained from the singers to make the blobs contact the suitable notes and create the suitable sounds to provide a joyous festive music.\n\nApart from the machine studying mannequin that powers the singing of the blobs, there may be one other one which makes them sing collectively. So, if you drag a blob to make it sing, the others will be a part of to create a melody that matches your pitch and vowel sound in real-time.\n\nSo, in case you are somebody who loves festive songs, you possibly can create your individual one utilizing Blob Opera. The outcomes can range from unique to essentially humorous as you possibly can manipulate the pitch and sounds in any means you need.

Sure, we've technically seen Wonder Woman later in the timeline with Batman v Superman and Justice League, but nobody really cares about continuity with those movies.\n\nThe first movie marked a refreshing change in superhero movies back in 2017 and we were big fans, except for the fact that it never really felt like Wonder Woman was the hero in her own movie. Instead, it was Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) who took the lead and Wonder Woman often felt defined by him, rather than her own actions.\n\nUnfortunately, the sequel repeats the same big mistake, even if it doesn't do it on the same scale as before.\n\nRelated: How to watch Wonder Woman 1984\n\nDespite Steve's death in Wonder Woman, there was never really any doubt that Chris Pine would return in the sequel. It's not just because Steve is often a major figure in the comics, but that Pine is so good in the role and shares such great chemistry with Gal Gadot that it'd be a shame to only get one movie's worth of it.\n\nSo our issue isn't with the return of Steve, but more the way that the sequel handles it for the most part.\n\nAt the start of the movie, it's clear that Diana is still affected by the loss of Steve almost 70 years earlier. She's still saving people and stopping bad guys (albeit while trying to keep a low profile) and she's working at the Smithsonian Institute in her 'normal' life, but she's shut herself away from life otherwise.\n\nEvery plane that Diana sees in the sky reminds her of what she lost, so it's no surprise that when she gets her hand on the Dreamstone, her first wish would be that she had \"more time\" with Steve.\n\nShe's not aware that it'll actually come true at that stage, but it does come true and understandably, she's delighted with Steve's return. This time around, he's the fish out of water and for a while, it seems like the dynamic has been sorted between the pair.\n\nRelated: Wonder Woman 1984's best Easter eggs and DC references\n\nIt's not great that every one of Diana's early actions is defined by Steve (or the loss of him), but the sequel makes sure that it doesn't get in the way of Diana's main aim to find out what nefarious things Maxwell Lord is up to. It's very clear that it's her movie and Steve is just along for the ride.\n\nHowever, when it becomes clear that Diana's wish came at the price of her powers and the presence of Steve is making her weaker, it's here where the sequel stumbles and makes the same mistake as the first movie.\n\nIn that first movie, Wonder Woman might have defeated Ares, but it's Steve that saved the world and, for the most part, Steve led the way. As we said at the time: \"He persuades her to join the war, he takes her (often by the hand) around Europe explaining what's going on, he assembles the team (of guys) and he ultimately sacrifices himself to save the day.\"\n\nAnd when the time comes for Diana to make the crucial decision in Wonder Woman 1984, again it's Steve that makes the decision for her.\n\nThey learn that the only way to stop Maxwell Lord and his endless wish-granting is to either destroy the Dreamstone (which basically means killing Maxwell) or getting people to renounce their wishes. That means that if Diana wants her powers back, she has to let Steve go.\n\nSteve knows this is the only way and he tells Diana this, but in an understandable reaction (and one that's really well played by Gadot), Diana rants at the unfairness of it all that she can't just have the one thing she wants, given that she sacrifices everything else all the time for the world.\n\nAfter she's badly beaten by Cheetah (Kristen Wiig), it seems as though Diana has accepted the inevitability of it, yet she still seems reluctant to do so even when she's struggling to walk.\n\nIt's not as though they come to a joint realisation that this is the final time they'll see each other because Diana knows what she has to do. Instead, it's only after Steve says that she has to give him up (again) that she finally does accept that it's what she has to do.\n\nIt's not Diana who tells Steve that she has to let him go in order to let her save the day, it's Steve who essentially pushes her into it. That Diana reluctantly does it after Steve's insistence means that it never really feels like it was her choice.\n\nWe have nothing against her initial reaction, but once that's happened, it would have given her stronger agency if she had made the call. It would have been a subtle change that would even have deepened the emotion of that scene.\n\nAfter this moment is out of the way though, there's no doubt that Wonder Woman 1984 rectifies one aspect of the first movie by actually making Diana's actions be the ones that save the world.\n\nHere's hoping though that Wonder Woman 3 (if it happens) goes one step further and not have any aspect of Diana's journey defined by Steve again.\n\nWonder Woman 1984 is out now in UK cinemas and will be released in US cinemas and on HBO Max in the US on Christmas Day.\n\nDigital Spy has launched its first-ever digital magazine with exclusive features, interviews, and videos.

In addition to a recurring on TNG, de Lancie\u2019s Q also appeared in multiple other Star Trek series and he is now hinting that there may be more to come.\n\nThe Star Trek Universe podcast pointed us to a recent video on Cameo.com \u2013 where fans can buy personalized videos from celebrities, including John de Lancie. This particular video was a Christmas 2020 message from a father to his son, where the actor starts out \u201cQ here, AKA John de Lancie,\u201d and he begins to talk about the family\u2019s shared love for Star Trek: The Next Generation. De Lancie then tells a story about how he got his Star Trek start in the \u201980s on TNG, where he also drops a tantalizing \u201cstocking stuffer\u201d of a possible future for Q:\n\nA voice behind my shoulder said, \u201cYou have no idea what you have got yourself into.\u201d It was Gene Roddenberry and I said, \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d He goes, \u201cOh, you\u2019ll find out.\u201d And here it is, 34 years later, I am finding out. Oh and by the way, here is a little stocking stuffer\u2026 You are going to be seeing more of me. Cheers. Merry Christmas. And let\u2019s just cross our fingers that 2021 is going to be better. It just has to be better than 2020.\n\nThis \u201cyou are going to see more of me\u201d comment is what is intriguing, suggesting de Lancie could be returning to the role of Q\u2014again. As Lower Decks fans know, de Lancie already returned as Q in 2020, voicing the role in the episode \u201cVeritas,\u201d which debuted in September. Even though this Cameo Christmas message was likely recorded recently, it\u2019s possible de Lancie was referring either to his appearance in \u201cVeritas\u201d or perhaps a return to Lower Decks in season two, which is currently in production and expected to arrive in 2021.\n\nCould it be for Picard?\n\nThere is an even more intriguing possibility, assuming he isn\u2019t just talking about \u201cVeritas.\u201d De Lancie saying \u201cYou are going to be seeing more of me\u201d could mean it won\u2019t be just his voice. There are three live-action Star Trek series either currently in production or soon to be in production. The most likely candidate for a Q appearance would be on the second season of Star Trek: Picard, which is expected to start shooting next month. Writing for the season has been going on since early in the year as production was to start in the summer, so guest actors would likely already be booked. And the first season of Picard featured a number of actors reprising their characters from TNG and the TNG era, with more expected for season two.\n\nThrough his many appearances on TNG and other Star Trek shows, Q has shown a particular fascination with Jean Luc-Picard, and Q played a significant role in the events of both the series premiere and series finale. In their last encounter in \u201cAll Good Things\u201d (see clip below) Q hinted he will see Picard again, saying \u201cthe trial never ends\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ll be watching, and if you are very lucky, I will drop by to say hello from time to time.\u201d\n\nThere is also another potential connection to season two. It has been confirmed that Whoopi Goldberg will be reprising her role as Guinan, and Guinan has a complicated and adversarial relationship with Q (see below clip), so having both appear could make sense.\n\nFor now this is all speculation. De Lancie could simply be talking about his September Lower Decks appearance, or maybe another voice role on Lower Decks (or even Prodigy). But Q did promise to keep in touch with Captain Picard, so maybe after 20 years, it\u2019s time for him to check in with his old friend Jean-Luc.\n\nSee more news and analysis on the Star Trek TV Universe.", "topic": "entertainment", "tag": "headline", "types": [], "claim": "", "verdict": ""}, {"url": "https://www.instyle.com/celebrity/victoria-beckham-christmas-card-chaos-video-instagram", "source": "instyle.com", "authors": ["Alicia Brunker"], "title": "Victoria Beckham Corralling Her Kids for a Christmas Card Photo Is So Relatable - InStyle", "pubDate": "2020-12-19T17:46:00+00:00", "description": "This week, the fashion designer shared a behind-the-scenes video of the chaos that ensued when attempting to gather her four children (and three dogs) for their family's annual Christmas card photo, and it couldn't be more relatable.", "imageUrl": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F14%2F2020%2F12%2F19%2FGettyImages-530783756-2000.jpg", "language": "en", "country": "ca", "content": "All things considered, Victoria Beckham is just your average mom (well, kind of).\n\nThis week, the fashion designer shared a behind-the-scenes video of the chaos that ensued when attempting to gather her four children (and three dogs) for their family's annual Christmas card photo, and it couldn't be more relatable.\n\n\"The making of\u2026.never work with kids or animals!! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Love you @brooklynbeckham @romeobeckham @cruzbeckham #HarperSeven,\" captioned a clip capturing the holiday madness.

That tragic crash in a Paris tunnel on a summer night in 1997 instantly opened Charles\u2019 mind \u2014 if not Camilla\u2019s \u2014 to the possibility they could be seen in public together and she could even become his wife.\n\n\u201cIt was the only thing he could think about,\u201d says a former courtier. \u201cEven while the British nation was still struggling to overcome its feelings of loss, Charles was already at work, plotting and planning. To be honest, I don\u2019t think Camilla knew anything about it at the start. But after a lifetime of walking in the shadow of his mother the Queen, and keeping his wits about him, Charles knew how the British establishment worked.\u201d\n\nTHE CAMILLAGATE SCANDAL: THE INFAMOUS LATE-NIGHT PHONE CALL THAT WRECKED THE ROYALS\n\n\u201cHe knew that with a mixture of flattery, charm, stubbornness, and bullying he would get what he wanted,\u201d the courtier added. \u201cAnd he wanted Camilla as his wife for a variety of reasons. First, he loved her with a consuming passion. The fact that their love affair was forced to remain secret for decades made his feelings towards her that much more intense. Second, he\u2019s a man who is all too aware of his own status. He pictured the moment when he would be crowned King. he wanted a wife by his side \u2014 not some mistress hiding upstairs in the gallery.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd last, he wanted to vanquish the critics who, for years, had been sniping at Camilla \u2014 for her looks, for her morals, for her drinking.\u201dGOING ON\u2019\n\nStill, Charles and Camilla went to massive lengths to avoid being photographed together after Diana died. British newspapers offered $2 million for the first photo of the lovers together.\n\nEventually, in 1999, as the hatred towards Camilla faded somewhat, the couple was photographed together at a carefully orchestrated event as they left a birthday party at London\u2019s Ritz Hotel. That August they were photographed again on a romantic holiday to the Mediterranean and soon after that Charles and Camilla began to attend public engagements as a couple.\n\nPrince Charles leaving with Camilla Parker Bowles after posing publicly for the first time together.

Need help with gift ideas? We're here to help! We'll be rolling out gift guides from now through the end of December. You can find our other guides right here.\n\nHeadphones! They make a pretty solid gift any year, but they're an even better option when so many of us are stuck at home. It's hard to think (much less get anything done) when the background track of your life is a cacophony of conference calls and Zoom school.\n\nWe spent a lot of time with a lot of different headphones this year, so we thought it'd be good to highlight some of our favorites. As with all things audio-related, \"best\" is deeply subjective \u2014 but these ones all absolutely earned our stamp of approval. Between over-ear, on-ear, in-ear and gaming headsets, we've got the bases covered.\n\nThis article contains links to affiliate partners where available. When you buy through these links, TechCrunch may earn an affiliate commission.\n\nMarshall\u2019s latest on-ear headphones combine great sound with a lightweight design, and some unique benefits -- including over 80 hours of playtime on a single charge. They also charge either via USB-C or wirelessly with most standard chargers, by folding them up and resting them on their right ear cup. The on-ear design means no noise cancellation and noise isolation is minimal, so they're not great for commutes but a very solid choice for the home office. For the price, they\u2019re a great deal, and a stylish accessory, to boot.\n\nIf you need really serious noise canceling and you aren't willing to sacrifice on sound quality, Sony's WH-1000XM4 over-ear headphones are a no-brainer.\n\nWidely regarded as the best at what they do, these headphones actually do quite a few different things very, very well. The sleek over-ear design and sophisticated active noise canceling means they can create a totally silent work environment if that's what you want. And if you're just in it for Sony's signature killer, punchy sound, that's enough of a reason to buy them too. (Bose\u2019s Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 are another top-tier pick for over-ear noise canceling if you prefer their look or Bose\u2019s more neutral sound.) For a budget pick, Sony\u2019s last-gen Sony WH-1000XM3 offer the same sound quality and noise canceling with a few fewer bells and whistles.\n\nThe MW65s are Master & Dynamic\u2019s wireless over-ear noise-canceling model. Between deejaying at dirty underground raves in my early twenties and editing videos for the next decade, I have probably gone through about two dozen headphones. By far, the MW65s are my favorite.\n\nThey're beautifully designed, and well-constructed with lightweight anodized aluminum and premium leather. The 40mm beryllium drivers deliver clarity throughout the spectrum and audiophiles will love their natural sound profile. The memory foam ear pads already do a decent job of muffling out garbage trucks and police sirens, but the ANC is great for shutting out the world \u2014 on high mode, it\u2019s eerily silent. The MW65s work wirelessly via Bluetooth 4.2 with 65+ feet of signal range -- a must-have for grabbing snacks from the fridge while on important Zoom meetings or to avoid accidentally yanking the laptop off the table. Bonus feature: Google Assistant integration.\n\nThey'll cost you a steep $400+, but they\u2019re solid headphones and you\u2019re ultimately paying for luxury.\n\nThe days seem longer when working from home and these Denon headphones are comfortable to wear from morning to night. And better yet, they sound fantastic with rich bass and crisp highs. The soundstage is incredible and the large cups easily block outside noise from interrupting your jam session. From hip hop to alt to underground indie classics, everything sounds better on these Denon headphones. I can\u2019t get enough of these Denon headphones. In OutKast\u2019s SpottieOttieDopaliscious the horns play over a lovely low-fi beat track. Uncle Tupelo's Sandusky is heavenly.\n\nThere\u2019s a downside to these Denon headphones: to really come alive, they require more power than a computer or phone alone provide. When tested on a computer, the headphones are great. When tested with a desktop headphone amp, they're out of this world.\n\nOut of all the headphones in this series, this set of cans from Grado are the most polarizing. On one side, they sound fantastic. The audio is crisp, clean, and complex. Silver Lining by Mt. Joy manages to be peaceful but powerful with strong guitar strums and complete soundstage. Turn on Heart of Gold from Neil Young and it\u2019s more of the same: the sound is clean and pure. These headphones are for purists. The housing is made out of compressed hemp and maple, which the company says balances the sound and produces some of the best audio properties of any of its headphones. True to their name and inspiration, the hemp headphones cost $420.\n\nWhile the audio is fantastic, these headphones perhaps fall short from being good work from home headphones. There\u2019s very little sound isolation from the foam pads and open design. I\u2019m wearing the headphones while I type this section and can clearly hear the click-clack of my mechanical keyboard while Sublime\u2019s Steppin\u2019 Razor plays through the cans.\n\nGrado is a family-owned outfit from Brooklyn where three generations work for the company. The company started building phono cartridges, expanded into building speakers, and currently sells headphones and phono cartridges. These headphones are hand-built in Brooklyn and are available with numerous options including terminating the wire with an XLR connector instead of the standard 3.5mm plug.\n\nIt should come as no surprise that Sony's prowess in over-ear noise canceling translates extremely well to a smaller form factor. Earbuds can\u2019t match the sweet silence that over-ear designs provide, but if you don\u2019t like big ol\u2019 headphones, the compromise is likely worth it. Sony\u2019s earbuds are a great choice, tuning out a shocking amount of outside noise in a very small package. Like the Sony over-ear pick, they have incredible sound, a very attractive design and come with a huge selection of rubbery caps of different sizes and textures to make them comfortable in different ears. If you value Apple connectivity above all else, pick the AirPods pro. If sound quality or silence matter more, you won\u2019t be disappointed here.\n\nAlso great: Sennheiser\u2019s Momentum True Wireless 2 ($269) earbuds keep pace with Sony\u2019s earbuds, and depending on your sound/fit preferences they\u2019re also a great pick (especially if you find them on sale.)\n\nThough Apple is now positioning the $249 AirPods Pro as the mid-range product in the AirPods line with the introduction of the ludicrously priced $549 AirPods Max, they are still Apple\u2019s headphone product that seems to have the biggest lead over mainstream competitors.\n\nFeatures like passthrough mode and spatial audio are nice but are likely features you will use pretty infrequently depending on your setup. As with the less expensive non-Pro AirPods, you\u2019ll be sure to find better sound quality in Bluetooth headphones at this price, but you won\u2019t find a better total package that involves so little troubleshooting, a tight package and such quality noise cancellation. The AirPods Pro are a finessed product that just work in a way that makes using other wireless buds comparably painful.\n\nRetailers are really looking to move product this holiday season, so if you\u2019re prodigious, you\u2019ll likely be able to score a good deal on these headphones, so if you\u2019re plotting an upgrade or trying to see what all the buzz is about, I recommend you take the plunge.\n\nSteelSeries 7P (for PlayStation) or 7X (for Xbox)\n\nWhether you're planning on playing games on a PC or any console out there, the SteelSeries Arctis 7 gets an unreserved recommendation from me. These headphones have amazing sound in a surprisingly large soundstage, making them suitable for any gaming or media. They're also light and comfortable while offering decent isolation (and can pipe in surrounding noise if you want). Plus there's a built-in telescoping mic for chatting. There are two versions, one for PlayStation and one for Xbox consoles, though both work with PC.\n\nTheir downsides are a cluttered physical interface \u2014 there's a lot going on on the undersides of the earcups \u2014 and a corded, multi-part (rather than USB key shaped) wireless dongle. But these are minor issues considering what you get for the $150 price.\n\nThis is my go-to headset for when friends need something solid but inexpensive. The sound is a bit bass-heavy and it\u2019s not wireless, but I used these personally for quite a while and found them comfortable, reliable, and the built-in mic is easily operated.\n\nWhile on the pricier end for a gaming headset, SteelSeries' Arctis Pros are outstanding. They're extremely comfortable largely thanks to a ski-goggle inspired suspension headband, and swappable rechargeable batteries (one in the headset, one charging in the base station) help ensure you're never caught scrambling for a charging cable mid-battle. A dedicated mixer helps you tweak the sound to your liking even in games where it's otherwise locked, and a very visible mute indicator on the tip of the microphone makes it clear whether you're on air or not. One catch: they'll work with PC, Mac and PlayStation (including PS5 with an upcoming firmware update), but not Xbox.", "topic": "tech", "tag": "headline", "types": [], "claim": "", "verdict": ""}, {"url": "https://biznews.co.ke/2020/12/20/health-insurance-a-market-worth-observing-growth-anthem-unitedhealth-bupa-kaiser-permanente/", "source": "biznews.co.ke", "authors": [], "title": "Health Insurance- a Market Worth Observing Growth: Anthem, UnitedHealth, BUPA, Kaiser Permanente - BIZNEWS", "pubDate": "2020-12-20T06:32:00+00:00", "description": "", "imageUrl": "", "language": "en", "country": "au", "content": "Global Health Insurance Market Size, Status and Forecast 2019-2025 is latest research study released by HTF MI evaluating the market, highlighting opportunities, risk side analysis, and leveraged with strategic and tactical decision-making support.

This handgun may not have the same destructive force as other weapons like V's missile launcher arms, but it makes up for that by auto aiming for the head of the target.\n\nOf course, Cyberpunk 2077 players have probably had a sort of love/hate relationship with Skippy. On the one hand, the talking pistol can be charming, but it can also be rather annoying. Perhaps more importantly, some players are locked into the Puppy-loving Pacifist mode, while others are still rocking Stone Cold Killer.\n\nRELATED: Cyberpunk 2077: Where to Get Epic Monowire Battery Mod\n\nFor those that don't know, when V first comes across the gun, Skippy gives the player a choice between those two modes of fire. Pupply-loving Pacifist will only shoot enemies in the leg, whereas Stone Cold Killer will always hit enemies in the head. After 50 kills with the weapon, Skippy will automatically permanently switch modes, locking the weapon in the other selection.\n\nAfter using Skippy for a while, players will unlock a quest to bring him back to his previous owner, Regina Jones. Completing this quest is simple, as players simply need to follow the quest marker and hand over the pistol, but it has some consequences. For one, players will lose Skippy, and they'll never be able to use or acquire him or another pistol like him again. That said, there is a reward, so it isn't a complete loss.\n\nTurning in Skippy causes Regina Jones to give the player 7,420 Eurodollars, but in the process she will factory reset the pistol and give it a new name. This prompts V to freak out a little, concerned that she just \"killed Skippy.\" If players have Skippy in Stone Cold Killer mode permanently, he is definitely worth keeping, especially if the player has been enjoying using it. For those that have Skippy stuck in Puppy-loving Pacifist, it may be better to just return it to Regina since it isn't going to be as powerful as some other weapons.\n\nPlayers that decide to keep Skippy despite his protests may have to deal with the gun calling V a \"bad owner\" over and over again, but at least they'll get to keep this iconic Cyberpunk 2077 weapon instead. It also should be said that players can choose to tell Skippy that they will return him and accept the quest but never go and do it.\n\nCyberpunk 2077 is available now on PC, PS4, Stadia, and Xbox One, and later on PS5 and Xbox Series X.\n\nMORE: Cyberpunk 2077: Where to Get Epic Fortified Ankles Cyberware", "topic": "tech", "tag": "headline", "types": [], "claim": "", "verdict": ""}, {"url": "https://bestgamingpro.com/how-to-use-an-amazon-echo-as-a-bluetooth-speaker-with-your-android-phone/", "source": "bestgamingpro.com", "authors": ["Dinu das"], "title": "How to use an Amazon Echo as a Bluetooth speaker with your Android phone - Best gaming pro", "pubDate": "2020-12-19T14:15:00+00:00", "description": "", "imageUrl": "", "language": "en", "country": "nz", "content": "Your Amazon Echo isn\u2019t just an effective smart assistant capable of managing your smart home.

Now the free Epic Games Store game for December 19 has been revealed, validating a previously-leaked list of free games in the process.\n\nAs expected, the free Epic Games Store game for December 19, 2020 is none other than The Long Dark. Originally released in 2017, The Long Dark is an open world survival game where players have to survive in a freezing wilderness. Like many other survival games, The Long Dark players have to keep their hunger, thirst, temperature, and more in mind if they hope to make it through alive. It includes a regular survival mode, a story mode, and a Challenge mode, giving survival game fans plenty of content to play through.\n\nRELATED: Nvidia Added a Game to GeForce Now Without Permission From Developer\n\nThe Long Dark earned mostly positive reviews at the time of its release, keeping up the trend that these Epic Games Store free games are generally high quality experiences. It marks the third game released as part of the Epic Games Store free games for December 2020 promotion so far, having been preceded by city management simulator City: Skylines and Oddworld: New 'n Tasty.\n\nThe Long Dark being made part of the Epic Games Store free games lineup is significant because it seemingly validates a leaked list of games that will be included in the promotion. That leaked Epic Games Store free games for December list has accurately named Cities: Skylines, Oddworld: New n Tasty, and now The Long Dark. If the rest of the list is accurate, then fans can look forward to adding Defense Grid 1, Alien: Isolation, Metro 2033, Tropico 5, Inside, Darkest Dungeon, My Time at Portia, Night in the Woods, Stranded Deep, Solitairica, Torchlight 2, and Jurassic World Evolution to their Epic Games Store collection in the coming days.\n\nAll of the games being released as part of the Epic Games Store free games for December 2020 promotion are generally well-received titles, with some standing out as having received particular critical acclaim. Inside won numerous awards when it first released, as did Night in the Woods. Alien: Isolation is nothing to scoff at either, with that game being hailed as one of the better survival-horror games in the last decade.\n\nIt's possible that the leaked list of Epic Games Store free games is inaccurate, but it's not looking that way. While they wait to see if the Epic Games Store free game for December 20 is Defense Grid 1 as leaked, fans can claim their free copy of The Long Dark.\n\nMORE: Survival Games: Genre Still Evolving From Early Mechanics", "topic": "tech", "tag": "headline", "types": [], "claim": "", "verdict": ""}, {"url": "http://validate.perfdrive.com/sportskeeda/captcha?ssa=ca0b533b-e082-5010-a4b6-6f9542930e94&ssc=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sportskeeda.com%2Fesports%2Ffree-fire-vs-cod-mobile-which-game-better-graphics-android-ios-devices&ssi=971e42ab-a33a-e2cc-98d5-3a692be7f8f5&ssk=contactus@shieldsquare.com&ssm=39537489054924298106492501838789&ssn=e3dac4d4fe7ea94ffd346ac19f1af8845b2465f1e042-bf5e-9b39-b5cd3a&sso=4d1ee3b2-8f907306407e08ce37f6a4f7bfea791067eb037ff6a2254b&ssp=94888317811608591617160856966620761&ssq=72882540810805942811208108688607639781791&ssr=MTQ0LjE2OC4xMzcuMTcw&sst=Mozilla/5.0%20(X11;%20Linux%20x86_64)%20AppleWebKit/537.36%20(KHTML,%20like%20Gecko)%20Chrome/57.0.2987.110%20Safari/537.36&ssw=", "source": "validate.perfdrive.com", "authors": [], "title": "Free Fire vs COD Mobile: Which game has better graphics for Android and iOS devices? - Sportskeeda", "pubDate": "2020-12-20T17:40:35+00:00", "description": "", "imageUrl": "", "language": "en", "country": "nz", "content": "We apologize for the inconvenience...\n\n...but your activity and behavior on this site made us think that you are a bot.\n\nNote: A number of things could be going on here.\n\u2022 If you are attempting to access this site using an anonymous Private/Proxy network, please disable that and try accessing site again.\n\u2022 Due to previously detected malicious behavior which originated from the network you're using, please request unblock to site.", "topic": "tech", "tag": "headline", "types": [], "claim": "", "verdict": ""}, {"url": "https://www.howtogeek.com/699418/how-to-change-the-weather-in-pokemon-sword-and-shield/", "source": "howtogeek.com", "authors": ["Joshalynne Finch"], "title": "How to Change the Weather in \u2018Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield\u2019 - How-To Geek", "pubDate": "2020-12-20T14:00:26+00:00", "description": "Some Pok\u00e9mon require specific weather conditions to appear, and you can change the weather in Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield\u2019s Wild Area to meet those conditions.

Some weather conditions\u2014fog, hail, and sandstorms\u2014are locked behind the story.\n\nThe Wild Area in Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield\u2019s Galar Region is an entirely new experience for all Pok\u00e9mon players; it is the first truly open-world section of the Pok\u00e9mon series.\n\nYou will encounter wild Pok\u00e9mon on the field in the Wild Areas. However, the Pok\u00e9mon you encounter will vary, depending on your location in the Wild Area as well as the weather. If it\u2019s raining, for example, more Water-type Pok\u00e9mon will appear.\n\nAfter you\u2019ve progressed far enough in the game, you can unlock additional weather conditions, such as fog, snowstorms, and sandstorms in the Wild Area.\n\nIn order for snowstorms and sandstorms to appear, you must first beat three gym challenges and reach the city of Hammerlocke in Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield. To force the appearance of foggy weather conditions, you must first complete the main story and become the Pok\u00e9mon Champion.\n\nOlder Pok\u00e9mon games have used time of day or season to determine different Pok\u00e9mon encounters. Pok\u00e9mon Sword & Shield, however, utilizes the weather. While the main routes of the game are typically stuck to specific weather and feature no variance, the Wild Area has a continually- shifting weather pattern.\n\nEvery day at midnight on your Nintendo Switch\u2019s Clock System, the weather in each area of the Wild Area will change, and there are certain Pok\u00e9mon that will only appear under certain weather conditions. However, on the first day of each month, every area in the Wild Area will have the exact same weather, and on these days you\u2019ll know what to expect:\n\nThe weather doesn\u2019t only affect Pok\u00e9mon spawns, it also affects battle conditions, and there are nine different weather effects to note: normal, overcast, raining, thunderstorms, snowing, snowstorms, intense sun, sandstorms, and fog.\n\nTo check the current weather in the Wild Area, load your game and press \u201cY\u201d on your right Joy-Con controller to pull up your main menu. From there, select the Town Map, and toggle weather conditions on and off with your map open by pressing \u201c+\u201d on your right Joy-Con controller.\n\nJust like some Pok\u00e9mon require trades to evolve, some Pok\u00e9mon require certain weather conditions in order to appear to the player in-game. Certain Pok\u00e9mon also require specific weather conditions to evolve. For example, the Pok\u00e9mon Eevee has a total of eight different possible evolutions, but two, in particular, require day and night conditions to evolve.\n\nDuring the daytime in the Wild Area, if an Eevee is in your Pok\u00e9mon party and has enough friendship points, upon leveling it will evolve into an Espeon.

For example, Ralts, a Pok\u00e9mon whose evolutions are popular in competitive play, can only be caught under foggy conditions in the Wild Area in Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield.\n\nTo see a complete list of Pok\u00e9mon that require certain weather conditions to appear, check the Serebii wiki.\n\nChanging the Weather in the Wild Area\n\nFirst and foremost, you\u2019ll want to completely close any launched game on your Nintendo Switch. You can do this by hovering over the game on your Switch\u2019s home screen, pressing the \u201cX\u201d button on your Joy-Con, then selecting \u201cClose.\u201d\n\nNext, from the Switch\u2019s home screen, go to the console\u2019s \u201cSystem Settings.\u201d The \u201cSystem Settings\u201d icon looks like a gear and is located between the Joy-Con icon and the Power button in the bottom toolbar.\n\nOnce you\u2019re inside the \u201cSystem Settings\u201d menu, scroll all the way down and select the \u201cSystem\u201d menu. Next, select the \u201cDate and Time\u201d option by pressing the \u201cA\u201d button on the right Joy-Con.\n\nThis submenu is where you change all of your time settings on the Nintendo Switch.\n\nTo customize the current time, select \u201cSynchronize Clock Via Internet\u201d to turn \u201cOff\u201d the automatic clock.\n\nChange the date or the time to whatever you want and press \u201cOK.\u201d It doesn\u2019t matter what time you pick, so long as it\u2019s different from the current time.\n\nNavigate back to the Nintendo Switch home screen by pressing the physical \u201cHome\u201d button on your right Switch Joy-Con and then launch the game.\n\nWhen you launch Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield and enter the Wild Area, the time of day and weather will change, depending on what you set your date and time to.\n\nTo turn the real-time sync back on, save and close the Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield game and navigate back to the \u201cDate and Time\u201d menu. Select \u201cSynchronize Clock via Internet\u201d to set it back to the \u201cOn\u201d position.\n\nThe weather is entirely random, and it changes at midnight on your Nintendo Switch System Clock. If you\u2019re not getting the weather you want to appear in your game, be sure you have the appropriate gym badges, and keep changing the date and time until your desired weather appears in the Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield Wild Area.", "topic": "tech", "tag": "headline", "types": [], "claim": "", "verdict": ""}, {"url": "http://validate.perfdrive.com/sportskeeda/captcha?ssa=b2397459-e713-fcb1-8cc9-f9089f83b146&ssc=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sportskeeda.com%2Fesports%2Fhow-get-wildcat-skin-fortnite-chapter-2-season-5&ssi=d5f9b253-a33a-e2cf-8625-7a717fbb5815&ssk=contactus@shieldsquare.com&ssm=32751440838042243107175214209299&ssn=0b5addb3cfbfd477faf8edfdfa62fd89f2489d6a109b-680a-644d-55cf80&sso=afa7f988-be1a6b12490f4ec077f36e999c15c7f27aeb3b8bdbdc171e&ssp=33178557271608520971160853456401284&ssq=42130720811117724110108111670918280146228&ssr=MjMuMjM2LjE4Mi4xODE=&sst=Mozilla/5.0%20(X11;%20Linux%20x86_64)%20AppleWebKit/537.36%20(KHTML,%20like%20Gecko)%20Chrome/61.0.3163.79%20Safari/537.36&ssw=", "source": "validate.perfdrive.com", "authors": [], "title": "How to get the Wildcat skin in Fortnite Chapter 2 - Season 5 - Sportskeeda", "pubDate": "2020-12-20T17:42:23+00:00", "description": "", "imageUrl": "", "language": "en", "country": "nz", "content": "We apologize for the inconvenience...\n\n...but your activity and behavior on this site made us think that you are a bot.\n\nNote: A number of things could be going on here.\n\u2022 If you are attempting to access this site using an anonymous Private/Proxy network, please disable that and try accessing site again.\n\u2022 Due to previously detected malicious behavior which originated from the network you're using, please request unblock to site.", "topic": "tech", "tag": "headline", "types": [], "claim": "", "verdict": ""}, {"url": "https://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/ladbaby-makes-a-flying-start-in-the-race-for-the-2020-official-christmas-number-1-with-don-t-stop-me-eatin-__31904/", "source": "officialcharts.com", "authors": [], "title": "LadBaby makes a flying start for the 2020 Xmas Number 1 - Official Charts Company", "pubDate": "2020-12-20T18:53:58+00:00", "description": "See how the Christmas Number 1 race is shaping up after the first 48 hours of sales and streams.", "imageUrl": "https://www.officialcharts.com/media/659345/xmas-number-1-contenders-2020-ladbaby-jess-glynne-mariah-carey-liam-gallagher.jpg?width=796&mode=stretch", "language": "en", "country": "gb", "content": "Reigning champion LadBaby starts out in pole position for the UK\u2019s Official Christmas Number 1 2020 with Don\u2019t Stop Me Eatin\u2019, charging out of the blocks in the biggest chart race of the year with huge sales.\n\nThe YouTubers aka Mark and Roxanne Hoyle have an impressive lead so far on the Official Chart: First Look, scoring 80,000 chart sales after 48 hours and on course to be one of the biggest opening weeks of the year.\n\nThe pair are currently the ones to beat as they set their eyes on a third consecutive Christmas Number 1 \u2013 following 2018\u2019s We Built This City and 2019\u2019s I Love Sausage Rolls \u2013 proceeds will once more benefit food bank charity The Trussell Trust.\n\nMORE: Look back at every Official Christmas Number 1 in UK chart history\n\nJess Glynne is on course for her highest-charting single in two years with This Christmas, which climbs seven places to Number 2 after the weekend\u2019s initial sales and streams.

That hasn\u2019t really been the main focus of their storyline, however.\n\nAfter a series of qualifying matches the week before, on Nov. 30 Styles, Keith Lee, and Riddle faced off in a Triple Threat to determine who would challenge McIntyre at TLC. A Phenomenal Forearm to Riddle earned AJ a chance to become a three-time WWE champion.\n\nAn hour later, Styles and his bodyguard Omos were ringside for a tag match between Drew & his buddy Sheamus and The Miz & John Morrison.\n\nMiz recently won the Money in the Bank briefcase from Otis. He and AJ entered into a kind-of alliance. They\u2019ll work together when it suits them, but they\u2019re both bad guys who want the belt, so it doesn\u2019t always suit them. It makes for an interesting wrinkle to what otherwise wouldn\u2019t be a very suspenseful story. Both men are compelling performers and future Hall of Famers. But the Phenomenal One is in the twilight of his career, and WWE\u2019s made it pretty clear they don\u2019t see the A-Lister as a top of the card guy.\n\nThose aren\u2019t all the pieces in play here, though. Sheamus was a heel not too long ago, and most fans have been waiting for him to betray his Scottish pal from the moment they shared a scene. After a malfunction at the junction in a two-on-three handicap match on Dec. 7, the two bro(ugh)s kicked each other\u2019s arses for a while before making up.\n\nAlso around this picture is Keith Lee. The Limitless has been presented as a friend of Drew since his call-up, and he\u2019s confronted the Celtic Warrior about his intentions on multiple occasions.\n\nOn the go home show this past Monday, Sheamus tangled with Styles, Lee fought Miz & Morrison in a handicap match, and AJ closed the show in a segment with the champ. In all three instances, the heels used their numbers advantage to get the upper hand. None of the good guys showed up to help any of the other good guys.\n\nIt makes for a lot of moving parts.\n\nAnd that\u2019s good, because we wouldn\u2019t give Styles or Miz much of a chance otherwise. And in theory, this sets up a bunch of different storyline options on the other side of TLC.\n\nIt\u2019s also kind of a bummer, though. McIntyre\u2019s largely been a \u201cshut up and fight\u201d character this year. It\u2019s been great for him, and nice for fans who\u2019ve long wanted WWE to give us a badass babyface champ who isn\u2019t also a jerk. A straight-up angle where he and the legendary Styles just want to prove who\u2019s the better man could have been great.\n\nBut that\u2019s not what we\u2019re getting. Instead it will be a no disqualification match that could feature involvement or run-ins from up to five different wrestlers, a heel turn and a cash-in.\n\nChaos it is then!", "topic": "entertainment", "tag": "headline", "types": [], "claim": "", "verdict": ""}, {"url": "https://411mania.com/wrestling/final-card-for-tonights-wwe-tlc/", "source": "411mania.com", "authors": [], "title": "Final Card For Tonight's WWE TLC | 411MANIA - 411mania.com", "pubDate": "2020-12-20T16:34:37+00:00", "description": "WWE airs its final PPV of 2020 with TLC tonight on WWE Network.

It\u2019s good for your soul, I think, to work. And it\u2019s also good for your soul to be told you have done a good job, whatever job you do.\u201d\n\nWeaver\u2019s first surprise Academy Award nomination, in 2011, for her steely, against-type performance as a suburban crime matriarch in Animal Kingdom, might have had a big impact on the kind of projects she was offered, but it didn\u2019t really alter her work habits.\n\nAfter wrapping principal photography on David Mich\u00f4d\u2019s underworld drama, the actress appeared in six plays across Australia \u2013 including a widely acclaimed production of Uncle Vanya starring Cate Blanchett, Richard Roxburgh and Hugo Weaving, and a regional tour of Steel Magnolias.\n\n\u201cCountry people knew I was working because they used to see me every few months in another play,\u201d says Weaver.\n\nWhether she\u2019s sparring on screen with Robert De Niro in Silver Linings Playbook or treading the boards opposite Michael Caton in a bare-bones theatrical production in an Australian country town, her criteria for taking a role are simple. First, she has to like the story. Beyond that? The character has to have some kind of a journey.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be Shakespeare,\u201d Weaver says in a Zoom interview from the freshly painted apartment she and her husband Sean Taylor recently bought in Los Angeles. A well-stocked bookcase warms the wall behind her.\n\n\u201cI mean, I\u2019d love just to do Tom Stoppard plays and only work with Martin Scorsese or Quentin Tarantino, but there are thousands of storytellers out there who have a decent story to tell.\u201d\n\nBesides, those two Oscar nominations (the other came for Silver Linings Playbook) mean something. Namely, she says with a laugh, \u201cThe second one proves the first one wasn\u2019t a fluke.\u201d\n\nBut the 73-year-old isn\u2019t convinced that those performances are even her best. \u201cI thought I did a good job [in Animal Kingdom] but I was pretty overwhelmed by the reaction it got,\u201d she admits. \u201cAnd I have also done some good things that didn\u2019t get so much attention.\u201d\n\nTaylor, for instance, believes his wife\u2019s work as Lee Harvey Oswald\u2019s mother in Parkland is one of her best. \u201cAnd that passed without much of a ripple,\u201d observes Weaver. \u201cYou go into everything thinking, \u2018This could be the best thing I\u2019ve ever done\u2019, even if you\u2019ve only got two or three scenes.\u201d\n\nWeaver doesn\u2019t have a lot of screen time in Penguin Bloom, an upcoming film based on the true story of an injured magpie that helped an Australian family overcome their grief, but she still makes an indelible impression.\n\nOne can sense the heartache and impotence that underpin her character\u2019s busybody behaviour as she hovers over her daughter, Sam (Naomi Watts), who has been paralysed from the chest down in a freak accident.\n\nWeaver met Watts briefly at the 2013 Oscars, where they were fellow nominees. \u201cI didn\u2019t really know Naomi apart from that and I hadn\u2019t worked with her before,\u201d she says. \u201cThat was the reason I wanted to do the film. I\u2019ve been a huge admirer of Naomi\u2019s ever since Mulholland Dr. It was great to observe her up close. She\u2019s terrific.\u201d\n\nDirector Glendyn Ivin\u2019s poignant adaptation of Cameron Bloom and Bradley Trevor Greive\u2019s bestselling book was one of the last films Weaver made before international borders were closed by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe inspirational drama was shot on location at the Blooms\u2019 real house, on a hill overlooking the ocean north of Sydney. \u201cFilming where we did brings home to you just how physically beautiful it is,\u201d says Weaver. \u201cIt\u2019s 100 miles of the most spectacular harbour and coastline. We tend to take that for granted.\u201d\n\nNot anymore. One of the few downsides to Weaver\u2019s late-career revival is the distance it puts between her and her family, including son Dylan, daughter-in-law Makiko, and her two grandchildren. \u201cI do miss them,\u201d the actor says. Still, the past eight months in virtual lockdown overseas have kept her busy with distractions.\n\nWhile the four projects Weaver had lined up prior to the pandemic have been shelved or postponed, she recently spent a month in Montana filming a guest role on the Kevin Costner TV series Yellowstone.\n\n\u201cIt was a strange experience because the coronavirus protocols were really strict. We were tested every day. We couldn\u2019t go anywhere. We wore masks. Nobody could go near anybody on set.\u201d\n\nAnd there\u2019s the matter of her new home. After a decade renting in West Hollywood, she and Taylor finally decided to put down some roots. \u201cIt\u2019s just a modest little flat, about 10 minutes from where we were living,\u201d she says. So there are plenty of moving boxes to finish unpacking and decorating to be done.\n\nShe has also been quietly developing a couple of projects of her own, even if she has no idea where they will go. \u201cHeaven knows when they are going to be able to be produced! I think we\u2019re stuck with this for quite a while.\u201d\n\nWeaver says lockdown confirmed her suspicions that she\u2019s a definite introvert. \u201cJust having my husband and my dog to talk to hasn\u2019t bothered me at all,\u201d she says. \u201cThe things I miss the most are intimate bars \u2013 I like a drink in a cosy bar \u2013 and the cinema.\u201d\n\nBefore the pandemic, she and Taylor went to the movies two or three times a week: \u201cYou only do justice to a filmmaker\u2019s vision if you see it in a proper cinema.\u201d But she hardly misses the attendant opening-night functions that come with the job.\n\nShe may be drawn to extroverts \u2013 \u201cThey are entertaining and bring out the best in people. I used to have a lovely time being with Derryn [Hinch, to whom she was \u201chappily married\u201d for 12 years], because I didn\u2019t have to say much at all. I could just observe and listen\u201d \u2013 but trying to force conversation with them in that environment can be a punish.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like parties. I find them difficult \u2013 talking to strangers about meaningless things. My husband and I usually find a corner and sit there... talking to each other.\u201d\n\nWhy Claudia Karvan stripped down to her underwear\n\nMelissa Tkautz: \u2018Simon Baker was my first real love\u2019", "topic": "entertainment", "tag": "headline", "types": [], "claim": "", "verdict": ""}, {"url": "https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/lifestyle/stellar/bridie-carter-on-home-and-away-mcleods-daughters-and-life-in-byron/news-story/50fc3cec43b661fb3e161ea23bca9c5d?nk=74f75eaca62c83c79b7d1d2a9fb2c575-1608508929", "source": "dailytelegraph.com.au", "authors": ["Adrienne Tam"], "title": "Bridie Carter on the return of McLeod\u2019s Daughters - Daily Telegraph", "pubDate": "2020-12-19T10:01:14+00:00", "description": "We&#039;re for Sydney", "imageUrl": "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/a6ea3d12fac448ddea51519a208c716e", "language": "en", "country": "au", "content": "The McLeod\u2019s Daughters star reflects on the show\u2019s longevity 12 years on and reveals how she really feels about Hollywood flocking to her hometown of Byron.\n\nYou said goodbye to McLeod\u2019s Daughters on January 31, 2009, but the show remains as popular as ever. Why do you think that is?\n\nI don\u2019t feel like this show ended. I feel like it\u2019s alive today, probably even more than it was back then. I really do.\n\nMcLeod\u2019s Daughters is bigger than us. It\u2019s bigger than you. It\u2019s bigger than me. It has a massive global following. And the wonderful thing that\u2019s happened through COVID has been this lifeline for not only people who are dedicated fans from the 2000s, but we have new fans coming on board all of the time. We have generations watching.\n\n[During this period] I started watching Outlander. It has got me through. I\u2019ve fallen in love with these characters. I had this moment when I was watching when I went, \u201cNow I get what people get with McLeod\u2019s.\u201d When a show is so beautifully made and the characters are so detailed and we can savour them, you really feel like they\u2019re a part of your heart and your family. Tess McLeod sits warmly in my heart. She always will; she\u2019s part of me.\n\nAnd apparently there\u2019s now a feature film being made?\n\n[Creator and showrunner] Posie Graeme-Evans is, at the moment, writing the feature script. If and when it comes back \u2013 of course, we know how hard things are to develop, but we\u2019ve all got our fingers and toes crossed \u2013 I can\u2019t imagine how profoundly intriguing it\u2019s going to be for me to revisit and step into Tess\u2019 shoes again.\n\nYou know, I always say [my son] Otis was on McLeod\u2019s. He was in my tummy \u2013 I was seven-and-a-half or eight months pregnant when I stopped, so he was on the show. And then I was back on set when he was four weeks old. I\u2019m a very hands-on mum, so he was on set every day. I was breastfeeding. It was chaos. So much has changed since then.\n\nNot only have I changed, but what\u2019s happened in Tess\u2019 life? It\u2019s a bit like you have multiple personalities, as an actor.\n\nSpeaking of multiple personalities, you\u2019ll be seen on Home And Away next year.\n\nBut you\u2019ve actually played two other characters on the show before [Toni Jarvis in 1995 and Brooke Taylor in 1999].\n\nYeah, it\u2019s amazing [laughs]. It\u2019s my third time and third character now. I knew I\u2019d been on Home And Away obviously, but it was such a long time ago and I was like, \u201cI don\u2019t even remember my character\u2019s name!\u201d\n\nI remembered one storyline because it was with Rachael Blake, who\u2019s a wonderful Australian actress. We were in NIDA together. I think the other one, it was back in the time of Nic Testoni and the beautiful Belinda Emmett [who passed away in 2006].\n\nIt was a very special time. It\u2019s a testament to the success and longevity of this wonderful Australian show called Home And Away.\n\nYour latest character on the show is Susie, who is a real-estate agent.\n\nSince Summer Bay is the most dangerous place to live in Australia, what with all the kidnappings, explosions and hostage situations, how hard is it for her to sell houses?\n\nShe\u2019s got a tough job! When I first started, the cast were like, \u201cOh, everything happens here. Murders, kidnapping\u2026 don\u2019t worry about it. This is just Summer Bay.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, OK. Thanks for the welcome.\u201d\n\nAudiences are so dedicated and committed that anything can happen. There\u2019s something really magical about that, I think. I fell off my chair when I received the phone call from my agent about Home And Away. It was in the middle of COVID and nothing was shooting.\n\nI said to my agent, \u201cWhat? How can this happen?\u201d I was so perplexed and astounded \u2013 and excited. And yes, Susie\u2019s a real-estate agent.\n\nI live in Byron Bay, so I\u2019m surrounded by real-estate agents [laughs]. It\u2019s crazy here at the moment. I\u2019m just so glad I\u2019m on my farm with nature and paddocks around me. And cows!\n\nIt certainly seems like Byron Bay is the place to be\u2026 [Carter lives there with her husband, clothing designer Michael Wilson, and sons Otis, 15, and Tobias, 10].\n\nI live on my farm and it\u2019s a very simple life. I talk to the women in the supermarket who I\u2019ve known for 20 years.\n\nI want to hear about how their day is going, I want to hear if they\u2019re recovering from their chemotherapy, I want to hear if their mum bought that couch or not. I want to hear about their lives because that\u2019s what connects me to my community, it\u2019s what makes me feel like I belong. And then I know I\u2019m alright and that I have a place in the world.\n\nI\u2019m not interested in surface stuff and shallowness. What interests me is other people.\n\nHome and Away returns to the Seven Network and 7plus in February 2021.\n\nWhy Claudia Karvan stripped down to her underwear\n\nMelissa Tkautz: \u2018Simon Baker was my first real love\u2019", "topic": "entertainment", "tag": "headline", "types": [], "claim": "", "verdict": ""}, {"url": "https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/dont-spread-hate-diljit-dosanjhs-response-to-kangana-ranauts-video-message-mika-singh-says-be-humble-187040", "source": "tribuneindia.com", "authors": ["Tribune India"], "title": "'Don\u2019t spread hate': Diljit Dosanjh's response to Kangana Ranaut's video message; Mika Singh says 'be humble' - The Tribune India", "pubDate": "2020-12-20T08:52:00+00:00", "description": "Tribune Web DeskChandigarh, December 20\r\nPunjabi singer Diljit Dosanjh has indirectly reacted to Kangana Ranaut's 2-minute video message on the microblogging website.&nbsp;\r\nKangana, on Saturday, ques", "imageUrl": "https://cmsimages.tribuneindia.com/gallary_content/2020/12/2020_12$largeimg_1781707160.jpeg", "language": "en", "country": "au", "content": "Punjabi singer Diljit Dosanjh has indirectly reacted to Kangana Ranaut's 2-minute video message on the microblogging website.\n\nKangana, on Saturday, questioned the Punjabi singer's and Priyanka Chopra's intentions behind lending their support to the ongoing farmers' protest.

I\u2019m Robert Winfree, relaying all of the comings and goings for you. Tonight is the go home show for the TLC PPV event so expect some strong work on a few fronts. Most notably the upcoming TLC match between Kevin Owens and Roman Reigns for Roman\u2019s Universal title, this feud has had a darn near criminally short build but both men worked their butts off to try and get it over. The Street Profits will defend their titles against Ziggler and Roode tonight, not sure if they\u2019ll have a funny finish to run it back at the PPV or if none of those guys are going to get the PPV paycheck. Carmella technically beat Women\u2019s champion Sahsa Banks last week (so you know, no need to pay for the rematch) but it was only via DQ and we\u2019ll probably get some kind of stipulation added to the match tonight. The last thing we may, or may not, get is some kind of sense of the Intercontinental title and the role it will play at TLC as we\u2019ve yet to get any kind of real clarity around that.\n\nQuick video recap of Roman being creepy last week, then Kevin Owens heads down to the ring. There\u2019s a lot of tables, ladders, and chairs around the entrance ramp and ring, just in case you didn\u2019t know what the TLC PPV was about. Owens on the mic, he\u2019s been waiting all week for this and he\u2019s not waiting any more, he demands Roman comes down. Roman doesn\u2019t. Owens heard the message from Roman to his family last week, and he talked with his family this week and he warned them not to watch his match with Roman at TLC. Not because he\u2019s afraid of what Roman will do to him, but because of what his family will think of him after what he does to Roman. He invites Roman again. Still no Roman though. A few weeks ago he heard Roman mention he cares how his sons look at him, Owens has bad news as if they judge him on his actions the last weeks he\u2019s just a hypocrite. Roman jumped him from behind last week after sacrificing a pawn like Jey Uso, which is pathetic. He knows Roman isn\u2019t the head of the table, he\u2019s a coward, and thinks Roman knows it too. Paul Heyman on the big screen now. He asks Owens to stop, they\u2019ve done this song and dance already. Heyman is here to confess a sin, he thought Owens was a masochist to come back looking for a fight with Roman after last week, which would marry with Roman\u2019s sadism. But Owens isn\u2019t a masochist, he\u2019s a martyr who\u2019ll pay any price to become the Universal champion, which makes him a dangerous opponent. Pain wont stop him, he\u2019ll have to be taken out. Owens cuts him off, if Roman wont come fight Owens then Owens will go find Roman. Owens heads to the back as Heyman looks nervous and we head to commercial. While the opening promo segment is a little tired as far as tropes go, this was solid from both Owens and Heyman.\n\nIn the back Adam Pearce is trying to talk down Owens as Owens stalks through the back, Owens isn\u2019t having any of that though. He runs to the locker room for Reigns, it\u2019s locked and he\u2019s stuck by a conveniently placed monitor as Roman\u2019s music hits so he can watch what happens next. He and Heyman head to the ring for their own promo time. Heyman hands Roman a mic, and the boos are turned down so we can hear Roman. He addresses Owens, saying he doesn\u2019t want to hurt Owens or his family but he\u2019s running around telling the world that he\u2019s a bad guy when he isn\u2019t a bad guy, he\u2019s just doing the things you have to do to be THE guy. Being THE guy is above the paygrade of Owens, and he advises Owens to stay in his lane. Roman will prove he\u2019s a good guy, he gives Ownes the same choice he gave Jey Uso. Owens heads back to the ring. Roman tells Owens to acknowledge him as the Tribal Chief and Head of the Table, and they\u2019ll be good. But if he can\u2019t, he\u2019ll end him, promising that Owens won\u2019t even make it out of the building tonight. Owens is coming down to the ring now, but Jey Uso jumps him from behind. Jey and Owens brawl on the ramp, then Roman gets involved. Roman and Jey stomp on Owens for a bit, Roman lays in some of the safest forearms you\u2019ll ever see. Officials finally show up to try and break things up, Roman tosses Owens into one of the barricades to punctuate the beating. Owens starts fighting to his feet as Roman hits the top of the ramp and we get a promo for the upcoming tag team title bout coming up next. That sends us to commercial. Pretty solid two segment group there, Roman and Owens both delivered on the mic.\n\nBack from break with a video recap of what just happened. In the back Jey and Roman are talking, Jey is happy Owens got the message. Roman says Owens doesn\u2019t understand yet, he\u2019s not going to listen or stop. He tells Jey to end him, he doesn\u2019t want to see Owens anymore.\n\nBack to the ring, where our tag team title match is getting ready to being. The champs come out first, I always prefer the champs coming out second personally.\n\nMatch #1 \u2013 Tag Team Title Bout: (c) The Street Profits (Ford and Dawkins) vs. Dolph Ziggler and Robert Roode\n\nDawkins and Roode start things off. Ziggler distracts Dawkins and Roode jumps on him. Ziggler tagged in, but Dawkins fights them off then tags in Ford. Stereo dropkicks from the Profits, then Ford starts kicking Ziggler on the mat. Roll up from Ziggler gets 2. Ford avoids a punch and hits a back suplex then a standing moonsault. Ford mocks Roode on the outside, then clubs him down but the delay lets Ziggler recover and cut off Ford on the top rope. Ziggler tries to suplex Ford from the apron into the ring but Ford fights off and kicks him down. Ford up top, and Roode shoves him off all the way to the barricade and send us to break again.\n\nWe come back with Ziggler rolling Ford up for a 2 count. Ford thrown into the corner, and Roode tagged in. They double team Ford, Roode\u2019s cover gets a 2 count. Roode smacks Ford around, then tags in Ziggler. Ziggler drop kicks the ribs, and covers Ford for another 2 count. Gut wrench from Ziggler, applying more pressure to the ribs. Ford crawling towards Dawkins, Ziggler rakes the eyes and moves Ford back to the heel corner. Roode tagged in and hits a gordbuster. Ziggler tagged back in, is there something up with Roode\u2019s cardio or something? Ziggler mocks Ford trying to tag Dawkins then grabs a rear bearhug. Ford back up, breaks the grip of Ziggler but Ziggler super kicks the ribs again. Roode tagged in, they set up a double team move in the corner but Ford tosses Ziggler all the way to the floor then avoids a rush from Roode. Ford after the tag, Roode tries to stop him but can\u2019t and here comes Dawkins. Dawkins runs wild on Roode, then flapjacks Ziggler and hits an exploder suplex on Roode. Roode eats a double underhook neck breaker for a near fall. Dawkins after the anointment, Roode counters for the DDT but neither gets it. Ziggler blind tags and hits an assisted fame-asser for a near fall. Ziggler tries a super kick, Dawkins blocks but eats an uppercut. Ziggler walks into the anointment, Dawkins tags Ford who hits the frog splash but the ribs are down for Ford. It takes Ford too long to cover and Roode is able to break it up. Roode tagged in, Roode with an O\u2019Connor roll and the tights, but Ford rolls through, grabs the tights of Roode and gets the pin.\n\nOFFICIAL RESULT: The Street Profits Retained the Tag Team Titles by pinfall\n\nThis was well executed, but felt almost identical to their match a couple of weeks ago right down to Ford getting shoved onto the barricade and his hurt ribs playing into a delayed cover frog splash. I wouldn\u2019t object to anyone going for 3 stars here though.\n\nPost match Ziggler and Roode complain about the results. The ref wont take their crap, threatens to suspend both of them. They back off at that threat.\n\nIn the back Jey jumps Owens with a steel chair. He tells Owens to stay down then walks off. Owens gets up as we get another commercial.\n\nKayla interviews Bianca Belair to bring us back. She asks Bianca what a win tonight over Bayley would do, she says Bayley isn\u2019t a role model, just the next person she\u2019s beating. She puts over Bayley\u2019s accomplishments, but tonight she\u2019s going to shine and beat her.\n\nIn the ring we\u2019ve go the Riott Squad waiting for Billie Kay and another mystery partner. Kay hangs out at the top of the ramp, she will introduce her own partner as she\u2019s a seasoned ring announcer (just check the resume) then announces Tamina as her partner.\n\nMatch #2 \u2013 Tag Team Match: Riott Squad (Liv Morgan and Ruby Riott) vs. Billie Kay and Tamina\n\nTamina overpowers Morgan to get us going. Morgan gets stomped in the corner, but Morgan avoids a rush and tags Riott leading to a double team kick. Tamina takes Riott down with a clothesline. Tamina trash talks Riott, shoving her around. Riott tries to fight back, gets shoved to the corner and Kay makes a blind tag then Tamina hits a Samoan drop onto Riott. Kay in to try and get the win but Morgan breaks up the pin. Riott escapes Kay, tags Morgan and they drop kick Tamina off the apron. Drop kick assisted flatliner to Kay and Kay is done.\n\nKay\u2019s woes continue, but there\u2019s nothing compelling going on here. That sends us to break.\n\nBack and Sommelier is setting up a champagne table in the ring for Carmella to come down to. We also get a video recap of Carmella vs. Sasha Banks from last week. Carmella heads down to the ring, she\u2019s planning on toasting Sasha Banks. Sommelier gives Carmella a mic. She sings a bit then says there\u2019s a selection of champagne here so she can decide which one she wants ringside for her victory at TLC. She mocks the fans, reminding everyone she\u2019s better than them and knows that Sasha Banks doesn\u2019t have what it takes to be a champion. Banks fight might have the physical attributes, but mentally she\u2019s weak when it counts. She brings up that this is currently Sasha\u2019s longest title reign, and that Banks is currently drowning in pressure and uncharted waters for her. Last week Banks felt her title slipping away so she got herself disqualified, which tells Carmella that Banks is already beaten. She says that when Sasha loses on Sunday Sasha will fall into such a deep dark place she might just break. Because really, who is Sasha Banks if she\u2019s not the boss or the best? Good question. Even Sasha doesn\u2019t know the answer to that question, and it\u2019s why Sasha comes unglued around Carmella and gets more desperate. But all this has made Carmella sad, and she wants booze to feel better. She does not care for the first glass, it tastes cheap and frantic, just like Sasha Banks. Sasha\u2019s music hits, Sommelier heads to the ramp to run interference but Banks comes from behind into the ring. Banks throws champagne into Carmella\u2019s face, and looks to lock in the Banks statement but Sommelier finally shows up to break that up. Banks slaps him, tries the backstabber but Carmella with another gimmicked bottle to the small of the back takes Banks down. Carmella poses as that segment ends. The promo was a bit too long and repetitive in verbiage, but Carmella delivered it well enough and she got to a salient point by the end. Just wish the journey to get there had been smoother.\n\nThat sends us to the back, Owens is with a trainer but Jey Uso is here to attack him. Jey winds up slamming Owens through a table, then screams at Owens to stay down. These are verging on comedy skits now instead of horrifying beatings, how many more times are we going to do this? That sends us to break again.\n\nBack from break, and Otis is here with Chad Gable.\n\nNakamura with a go behind early but Otis over powers him. They trade arm wringer escapes, though Otis just used a slam then a falling headbutt. Nakamura to the apron, he lands a kick then heads out of the ring and hits a running knee to Otis draped on the apron. Grounded knees from Nakamura in the ring, then kicks as Otis gets back up. Otis is firing up though and lands a clothesline then a flapjack. Running discus clothesline from Otis, he hits an avalanche in the corner and sets for the Caterpillar but Gable is up on the apron and wants him to do a suplex instead. Nakamura counters with a roll up for a near fall. Otis with an exploder suplex, then a Vader bomb to pick up the win.\n\nNearly dud territory, but this is what should have happened last week to introduce this duo and set up the tag team failures later.\n\nIn the back Sami agonizes over his Sami Awards. He runs off to get polish for the \u201ctrophies\u201d and as he\u2019s gone Big E shows up, sort of laughing maniacally.\n\nThat sends us to some badly animated doohickey with Drew McIntyre then a series of other guys hitting finishers on a 2020 monster. I\u2019m not sure if that was awful or great. Both maybe? Anyway that sends us to break.\n\nWe come back to Otis and Gable celebrating in the back. Gable asks why Otis didn\u2019t hit the Caterpillar, Gable says the Alpha philosophy is \u201cdon\u2019t do what I say, do what I mean\u201d. I kind of hate that I get what he\u2019s going for there. He tells Otis to rehydrate.\n\nNow to the top of the entrance ramp where Sami Zayn is here to present the Sami awards. Because the Slammy\u2019s have taken a dive recently, they\u2019re about highlighting corporate favortism while the Sami\u2019s are about the will of the people. He sends us to a video package all about how great he is. Back from that he\u2019s ready to present the first Sami award for Comeback of the Year. He brings up names like Edge, and Roman Reigns but does feel his name is in contention. He opens the envelope and the winner is Sami Zayn. Apparently this is a surprise, and he\u2019s happy about the recognition. He doesn\u2019t want to make this all about himself though, so next up will be the Sami for Match of the Year. The award goes to. . . Sami Zayn vs. AJ Styles vs. Jeff Hardy in a ladder match. Sami really wanted to win this one. Next is the big one, Superstar of the Year. The winner is. . . Big E. Big E shows up, shoves Sami aside and is happy. He thanks his college therapist first, Zayn shoves him aside, trying to get a recount but Big E just clubs him to the body. Big E tosses Sami down the ramp, takes his trophy, thanks the crowd again and then breaks the trophy to stand tall. A little too long, but Big E does goofy well and he\u2019s found the right kind of dance partner in Zayn.\n\nIn the back with Kayla, she\u2019s got Bayley for an interview. Bayley heard Bianca\u2019s interview earlier and thinks it was nice of Bianca to have said nice things about her earlier. She runs down Bianca\u2019s track and field accomplishments, but that doesn\u2019t matter in the ring. Tonight she\u2019s going to put Bianca on the mat.\n\nBack to the ring for Bianca Belair\u2019s entrance. She\u2019ll battle Bayley next.\n\nBack from break and Bayley is ready to head to the ring.\n\nThey tie up, Belair is stronger and avoids Bayley. Bayley stomps the foot, Belair returns it. Bayley ties up Belair in the ropes, but does break clean. Shoulder tackle from Belair then she had stands over Bayley. Bayley to the apron and snaps Belair over the top rope. Belair sweeps the legs and then pulls Bayley back into the ring. Belair with a gymnastics routine, mocks Bayley again then kicks her in the face when Bayley charges at her. Bayley avoids a handspring move and then slams the arm of Belair on the ring apron. On the outside Bayley slams Belair into the barricade to send us to another break. Slightly odd pacing there, we barely got back.\n\nWe come back to Bayley tossing Belair out of the ring again. Belair shoves Bayley into the ring steps and gets back in the ring. Bayley barely beats the count. They trade rights and both are down again. More rights from Belair as they\u2019re up, she drives Bayley to the shoulder and unloads on her. Delayed suplex from Belair, then she kips up, guess her time selling the arm is done. Belair works the arm of Bayely, hits a handstand springboard moonsault for a 2 count. Backbreaker from Belair, then another one for a near fall. Belair drags Bayley to the corner, then climbs up top but Bayley catches her with a right. Bayley with a top rope attempt but Belair hits a suplex after avoiding that. Bayley drops a charging Belair onto the top rope then charges but eats the same move. Spinebuster from Belair but that only gets 2. Bayley lands a kick, rolls up Belair and tries to put her feet on the ropes but the ref catches that. Belair blocks a belly to belly, avoids a rush and gets a couple of roll ups then sets for a powerbomb but Bayley rakes the eyes, hits a Rose Plant and wins.\n\nNot bad, but while Belair has personality and athletic ability she still doesn\u2019t quite feel like a finished product. Though that might be entirely by design, and kudos if it is because it\u2019s coming across.\n\nRoman Reigns comes to the ring again with Heyman and Jey. Apparently Roman will deliver a promo to close the show after the break.\n\nBack from break and Roman gets a mic from Heyman. He can\u2019t understand why Kevin Owens is blowing his chance to be in the main event of PPV and on the Island of Relevancy. This is a chance for legacy- he\u2019s cut off by the music of Kevin Owens. Owens staggers down to the ring, Jey Uso looks to intercept but Owens gets a chair and clobbers him a few times. Owens into the ring and starts brawling with Roamn. Jey from behind with a super kick, then Roman spears Owens. Roman with more chair shots while Jey sends hardware into the ring. Jey sets up a couple of tables while Roman lays in more chair shots. Roman tosses Owens into Jey, who hits a spinebuster through the first table. Roman asks Owens if this is all worth it. He Samoan drops Owens through the second table. Jey heads out to get a third table, while Roman uses the broken table pieces to abuse Owens some more. Roman buries Owens in the rubble, Jey gets ladders into the ring. They bury Owens under tables, ladders, and chairs then they abuse the pile of detritus. Roman and company head up the ramp and into the back. They meet Kayla at the gorilla position, but Owens is fighting back to his feet and they see that on the monitor. Owens has a mic, he tells Roman nothing can keep him down. At TLC he\u2019s going to take the title, or die trying. That ends the show. Not the strongest segment, but at least they avoided the comedy bits that was turning into with Jey jumping Owens constantly.", "topic": "entertainment", "tag": "headline", "types": [], "claim": "", "verdict": ""}, {"url": "https://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/12-year-old-dj-has-equipment-seized-after-rave-in-school-toilets/IP7OL6UOLATUELSYZHJF2PE4PE/", "source": "nzherald.co.nz", "authors": [], "title": "12-year-old DJ has equipment seized after rave in school toilets - New Zealand Herald", "pubDate": "2020-12-20T02:07:12+00:00", "description": "The toilet rave included complimentary soft drinks and Cadbury Twirls.", "imageUrl": "https://www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/4M683eskXqWy5VvU_aNH1aA_N14=/1200x675/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/LCNWV4D4TOCQFOHGDJDR27TFOU.png", "language": "en", "country": "nz", "content": "Cael hosted a rave in the bathroom of his school in Manchester. Photo / Supplied\n\nA 12-year-old schoolboy had his DJing equipment confiscated after teachers busted him hosting a rave for fellow colleagues in the school bathroom.\n\nCael Bell, from Manchester, held an impromptu rave in the school toilet at St Antony's Catholic College, during the lunch break on December 11.\n\nAccording to his mum, Louise Bell, the boy sent out a Snapchat invite to \"all the boys from year 8\".\n\nThe rave included complimentary soft drinks and Cadbury Twirls as Cael showed off his turntable skills with a DJ set.\n\nThe party lasted a good 30 minutes before the party police arrived and broke it up.\n\nAccording to the mum, Cael's speakers and lights have been seized. However, she has decided she will not be punishing his son for putting on the event.\n\n\"I had to laugh,\" she told The Mirror. \"It has been a terrible year and I couldn't be angry with my son for trying to spread some cheer. When I got the call, it made perfect sense.\"\n\nAccording to the mum, the boy had been up and ready for school earlier than usual that morning, and rearing to go, which she admitted wasn't quite normal behaviour for him.\n\n\"He had the biggest smile on his face so I knew he had something up his sleeve. I asked him what he was so happy about and he told me they were having a rave in school. I thought nothing of it, I didn't think for one minute there was any truth to it,\" the mum added.\n\n\"But when I heard what Cael had done, from advertising the rave on Snapchat to actually pulling it off and even providing refreshments, I couldn't help but see the funny side. Cael's dad thought it was hysterical, he said 'go on son'. We did have a conversation about whether or not we should be angry but how could we be?\"\n\nThe mum posted about her son's antics on Facebook and the post quickly went viral with many commenters deeming Cael a \"legend\".", "topic": "entertainment", "tag": "headline", "types": [], "claim": "", "verdict": ""}, {"url": "https://nz.news.yahoo.com/princess-charlotte-had-funniest-reactions-132700130.html", "source": "nz.news.yahoo.com", "authors": ["Emily Dixon"], "title": "Princess Charlotte Had the Funniest Reactions to a Christmas Show - Yahoo News NZ", "pubDate": "2020-12-19T13:27:00+00:00", "description": "Her faces are everything. \ud83d\ude02", "imageUrl": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5SpfBQbS0WHhSZltDXv_Pg--~B/aD03MjI7dz0xNDQwO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/delish_597/a530fca883f2856cd899174182d74bb1", "language": "en", "country": "nz", "content": "Last Friday, Kate Middleton and Prince William took children Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis to the Palladium theater in London to see Pantoland, a festive pantomime held for key workers and their families. And according to the photos inside the theater, Charlotte had the best imaginable time, reacting vociferously to the show from the family's private box.\n\nA quick explanation of the pantomime tradition, for the non-Brits out there: They're family stage shows, typically performed around Christmas, blending music and comedy and a whole lot of audience participation. Audience members typically boo and heckle the villains, cheer the heroes, and chant classic refrains like \"He's behind you!\", \"Oh, yes it is!\", and \"Oh, no it isn't!\" Which makes them very fun for most kids, and exceedingly stressful for the painfully shy ones, leaving them with a lifelong terror of audience participation and a strong likelihood, at the age of 7, to have a full panic meltdown during the bit in Cats when the titular cats dance through the audience. Or maybe that's just me!\n\nAnyway, with that in mind, let's appreciate Charlotte's very enthusiastic responses to Pantoland, which she engaged in far more vigorously than brothers Prince George and Prince Louis. (Being a serious journalist, allow me to add the caveat that these photos might not have been taken during the show itself, and Charlotte might have just been reacting vehemently to some drama in the audience.)\n\nLook at Charlotte shouting! Is she engaging in a mass crowd chant of \"He's behind you?\" Is she booing at the pantomime villain? Or is she not shouting at all, but simply aghast at the events transpiring on stage? Either way, this photo is excellent!\n\nHere, a cheeky grin as she giggles with brother George!\n\nCharlotte cowers in terror as the pantomime takes a turn for the tense! (Or, alternatively, just leans in for a hug from her mom.)\n\nA brief emotional moment, with Kate quick to prevent a breakdown reminiscent of me watching Cats in 2000:\n\nCharlotte and Louis lean in for a better look at the action:\n\nTo conclude: I'm choosing to believe this is a photo of the second littlest Cambridge heckling the pantomime villain with all her tiny might, because that would be adorable:\n\nAnd that was your 2020 edition of Princess Charlotte Goes to the Pantomime.

Left tackle Eric Fisher will be active for the game.\n\nFisher missed practice on both Wednesday and Thursday with what head coach Andy Reid described as a \u201ctight back,\u201d but practiced fully on Friday. He was listed as questionable in Friday\u2019s final injury report.\n\nReid used the same phrase to describe the injury to offensive lineman Mike Remmers. The ninth-year veteran \u2014 who has been filling in for right tackle Mitchell Schwartz since he left the Week 6 game against the Buffalo Bills with a back injury \u2014 missed all of this week\u2019s practices. Listed as doubtful on Friday, Remmers was downgraded to out on Saturday.\n\nWe expect that undrafted rookie Yasir Durant \u2014 who played in Remmers\u2019 place for much of the Week 14 game against the Miami Dolphins \u2014 will start in his place. But we could also see Martinas Rankin or even veteran Stefen Wisniewski \u2014 the latter moved from the practice squad to the active roster on Saturday \u2014 somewhere in the mix. Rankin has been healthy \u2014 but inactive \u2014 during the last two weeks.\n\nLinebacker Damien Wilson (knee) didn\u2019t practice all week. Listed as out on Friday, he\u2019ll miss his second game with this injury. Expect to see Ben Niemann and rookie Willie Gay Jr. getting more playing time.\n\nRunning back Darwin Thompson (illness) was also listed as out. He has been sick since Thursday. Tight end Ricky Seals-Jones missed Thursday\u2019s practice with an illness, but practiced fully on Friday. He \u2014 and the rest of the Chiefs players on Sunday\u2019s inactives list \u2014 should be considered healthy scratches for the Saints game.\n\nWide receiver Bryon Pringle \u2014 who has missed three games with an ankle injury \u2014 was activated from injured reserve on Saturday. He is active for the game. Also available will be two practice-squad players: cornerback DeAndre Baker and liebacker Emmanuel Smith. Both were given one-game elevations to the active roster on Saturday and are active for the Saints game.. They will automatically revert to the practice squad on Monday.\n\nThe Saints have also released their list of inactives for the game. The big headline is that quarterback Drew Brees will be available for the game \u2014 and will likely start.\n\nBrees has been practicing all week, but was still on injured reserve after missing four games with broken ribs and a punctured lung. On Friday, news broke that he was expected to start against the Chiefs. The team officially activated him to the active roster on Saturday, opening the way for him to play. The team will only have Taysom Hill available to step in. On Saturday, the Saints released backup quarterback Trevor Simien \u2014 and on Sunday, backup quarterback Jameis Winston was placed on the reserve/COVID list.\n\nBrees\u2019 best receiving target will miss the game. Wide receiver Michael Thomas (ankle) missed all of the Saints\u2019 practices this week. Previously listed as out, Thomas was placed on injured reserve Saturday. Wide receiver (and return specialist) Deonte Harris (neck) missed practice on Wednesday and was limited in Thursday and Friday\u2019s practices. He had been listed as questionable, but was also placed on injured reserve on Saturday.\n\nStarting right guard Nick Easton (concussion) will miss the game, too. He was absent from all practices this week and had already been declared out. The Saints are expected to start rookie Cesar Ruiz in his place.\n\nDefensive lineman Malcolm Brown (shoulder/calf) had also been declared out after missing practice all week.\n\nThe rest of the New Orleans inactives should be considered healthy scratches.\n\nThey Saints signed three players from their practice squad to their roster on Saturday: center Will Clapp, wide receiver Juwan Johnson and wide receiver Tommylee Lewis.

The Niners had a sack-fumble and a muffed punt in the first quarter. That spotted the Cowboys 14 points, not even halfway through first. It felt like it would be that type of game.\n\nWhen San Francisco didn\u2019t turn the ball over, they moved the ball. Weird, isn\u2019t it? Raheem Mostert felt like he was close to breaking one of his touches on a few occasions. The running game was rolling, as Mostert and Jeff Wilson Jr. combined for 17 carries to rush for 83 yards early on. The play-action passing game was there, and Nick Mullens even made a few plays with his legs. The offense punched it in on a shovel pass to Brandon Aiyuk to make the score 17-14.\n\nDallas was fortunate on offense during the first half. The 49ers' defense missed a few tackles to give the Cowboys a first down. On one third down, Richard Sherman made life far too easy and gave Michael Gallup too much space. The Cowboys averaged 5.8 yards per pass and 2.8 yards per rush before they took over prior to the two-minute warning.\n\nDallas elected to attempt a 60-yard field goal with 27 seconds left in the half, which was a terrible decision. But San Francisco couldn\u2019t move the ball at midfield before the half, which kept the score 17-14.\n\nThe broadcast struggled during the first half. They called Trent Williams \u201cTrent Brown.\u201d They also said Jaylon Smith was in coverage on CeeDee Lamb. The announcers and the players were off.\n\nThe defense came out hot to start the second half as Javon Kinlaw, who earlier was responsible for Arik Armstead\u2019s first sack, beat his man for a TFL. Then, Fred Warner had a big hit on the running back. On third down, the 49ers got pressure on Andy Dalton, and Kinlaw forced a fumble. The refs ruled that Dalton didn\u2019t fumble, which was a bad call, but the 49ers' offense ended up in Dallas\u2019 territory a few plays later.\n\nThe offense marched the field but stalled on third-and-1. Kyle Shanahan had a decision to make and elected to kick a 41-yard field goal. Gould was good, and that made it 17-17. Based on the game-flow, it felt like the correct decision to kick a field goal. Dallas hadn\u2019t sustained a drive against you or shown that they\u2019re capable of doing so. The 49ers' offense had proven they could move the ball, so that wasn\u2019t going to be the last time you\u2019d be in Cowboys territory.\n\nAfter suffering a concussion on a big hit where he was involved with Lamb, Jimmie Ward left the game. He did not return. Dion Jordan was also ruled out. By the way he was tackling, Sherman checked out as well. He missed a few tackles on the afternoon, including one that led to a Cowboys touchdown.\n\nOn the previous third down play, Armstead let Dalton out of the pocket to allow a completion deep, where Marcell Harris, Ward\u2019s replacement, was nowhere to be found. That came on a third-and-6. So as soon as it felt like Shanahan made the correct decision to go for it, Dallas follows that up with a touchdown. That score made it 24-17.\n\nOn the ensuing drive, Wilson Jr. came up hobbled and was grimacing on the sidelines. Tevin Coleman checked in. Speaking of running backs, the 49ers finally hit Kyle Juszczyk on \u201cleak,\u201d a generally automatic play. Kevin Harland thought the crowd was booing, but they were screaming \u201cjuice.\u201d There were 30,000 fans on hand for this game, and there was a lot of red in the stands.\n\nJordan Reed made up for a drop on the first drive by making a play on third down to keep the drive alive. Aiyuk had a gain of four yards where he broke two tackles, and Wilson Jr. punched it in to tie the game at 24. The defense forced a punt after K\u2019Waun Williams broke up a pass to give the offense the ball back. The Niners went three-and-out, and Mike McGlinchey left the game after having the wind knocked out of him.\n\nIn what felt inevitable, Mullens threw a brutal interception where he stared down the receiver. Mullens was fortunate not to throw multiple interceptions, but this throw specifically highlighted his lack of arm strength. On the next drive, Aiyuk broke up a pass, and Mullens had another throw where the defensive back got his hands on the ball.\n\nAs they tend to do, the defense did their job and got the ball back for the offense. After a late hit penalty against McGlinchey, Dallas was flagged for defensive pass interference against Aiyuk. Mullens, as only he could, threw it over the middle without noticing an underneath defender. That\u2019s been a problem for 49ers quarterbacks for a while now.\n\nDallas scored on the next drive to make it 34-24. That felt like ball game, and it was. For the eighth game in a row, turnovers cost San Francisco. They\u2019ve been fortunate to win a couple of games in between, but you can\u2019t turn the ball over four times and expect to win.\n\nA late field goal made it 34-27. Then Lamb returned the onside kick to make it 41-27, Cowboys. Bourne caught a hail mary from C.J. Beathard to make it 41-33. That was ugly. Dallas scored 24 of their points off turnovers.", "topic": "sports", "tag": "headline", "types": [], "claim": "", "verdict": ""}, {"url": "https://www.elevenwarriors.com/ohio-state-football/2020/12/119545/ryan-day-says-chris-olave-will-return-against-clemson-due-to-big-ten", "source": "elevenwarriors.com", "authors": [], "title": "Ryan Day Indicates Chris Olave Will Return Against Clemson Due to Big Ten | Eleven Warriors - Eleven Warriors", "pubDate": "2020-12-20T18:37:23+00:00", "description": "Ryan Day indicates that Ohio State will get Chris Olave back in time to face Clemson after the Big Ten reduced its return-to-play rule to 17 days.", "imageUrl": "https://www.elevenwarriors.com/sites/default/files/styles/904x490/public/c/2020/12/119545_h.jpg?itok=boSG0Idn", "language": "en", "country": "us", "content": "It looks like Chris Olave will be back to face Clemson.\n\nOhio State missed its star receiver in its Big Ten Championship matchup with Northwestern, but Ryan Day indicated Olave will be back in time to compete in the College Football Playoff semifinal against Clemson.\n\nDuring an interview with ESPN, Day fielded a question about developing rhythm and continuity with the lineup constantly in flux, and he mentioned getting Olave back.\n\n\"That's the problem we've had.

If the rule remained at 21, Olave would have likely been unable to compete in the College Football Playoff semifinal if he tested positive.\n\nOhio State was out several other key players against Northwestern, as well, and it's not yet clear how many \u2013 if any \u2013 others are able to return under the conference's rule change.\n\n\"A good amount of them, yep,\" Day said when asked about potentially getting players out. \"But then there's also some that are really close based on what that number is that we're talking about.\"\n\nThe Big Ten decided to reduce the minimum number of days all athletes \u2013 not just football players \u2013 who test positive for coronavirus must sit out of competition for a minimum of 17 days, per ESPN's Adam Rittenberg.\n\nRELATED Chris Olave Still Hasn't Gotten Over How the Fiesta Bowl Ended, But He's Focused on the Future Now\n\nOlave was at the center of the play that ended last year's game against Clemson \u2013 and Ohio State's season \u2013 when Justin Fields threw an interception in the end zone at the game's closing seconds.

Penn State finished as just one of two Big Ten teams (the other was Rutgers) to play all nine of its scheduled games after the conference reinstated its season in September before starting in October, and there aren\u2019t many schools nationwide who can say the same. They did it through a combination of a very good plan, sound medical advice, and also some luck along the way.\n\n\u201cI am very proud of everybody for battling through,\u201d Franklin said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to do this under normal circumstances. I\u2019m also really proud of how we\u2019ve kept everybody healthy. We did have issues with false-positives, we\u2019re up to 66 false-positives. That\u2019s people missing practice, work; we had a bunch this week, and that puts you on an emotional roller coaster as well.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, I\u2019m proud of how we handled it, the whole big picture and keeping these guys safe and healthy, and then finding a way to battle back as the season went on. We have a lot of work to do. There were a lot of distractions this season.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt says a lot about our chemistry, our brotherhood. After the 0-5 start, boys could have opted out, or anything could have happened. We stuck together, we fought through it. We finished out with four strong ones.\n\nLet\u2019s get to the rest of this week\u2019s installment.\n\u2022 None More: Penn State-Illinois takeaways: Why wasn\u2019t Lamont Wade a returner sooner? Jahan Dotson\u2019s shines again, more\n\nPenn State has decided not to play in a bowl game, which is certainly a reasonable but unexpected decision, considering the fact that the Lions\u2019 players who spoke in recent weeks sounded like they wanted to play.\n\nThat said, this has been a year and season filled with tremendous sacrifice, and no one can blame any member of the program for wanting to end the season as opposed to prolonging it for one more trip and another game.\n\nOur student-athletes will now have the opportunity for a well-deserved break to enjoy time with their families before returning for the spring semester,\u201d Pen State Vice President of Intercollegiate Athletics Sandy Barbour said. \u201cI would also like the recognize all of the coaches and support staff members who have also made numerous sacrifices of their own for our student-athletes to compete this fall and moving forward.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs you know, we rely on our captains and Leadership Council to provide a voice for our team, and our student-athletes made the difficult choice not to participate in a bowl this year in order to spend time with loved ones. We are fully supportive of their decision, knowing it has been many months since our students-athletes have been able to spend time with their families and the challenges they endured, both physically and mentally. This will be an opportunity for our guys to go home, see family and recharge for the spring semester.\u201d\n\n--It\u2019s a shame that both Jahan Dotson and Lamont Wade could be gone next season, as the duo appear to be the best return team tandem the Lions have had in quite a long time, even if we\u2019re just a bit removed from Saquon Barkley and KJ Hamler at times teaming up.\n\n--Speaking of Dotson, wow has he become a star. He should definitely merit All-American consideration, as he\u2019s simply been stellar in 2020.\n\n--Linebacker Brandon Smith still has issues at times when it comes to tackling in space, but he sure can thump opposing players and he also closes like a runaway freight train. He finished the Illinois game with a team-high eight tackles, three of which went for a loss.\n\n--Penn State is in a tough place in its running backs room, what with Journey Brown medically retired, Noah Cain out for the year, and Devyn Ford unavailable for undisclosed reasons. But, Keyvone Lee and Caziah Holmes have really stepped up, and finished the final regular season game by combining for three touchdowns.\n\nWhat a weird, strange sprint this Penn State football season has been. It goes without saying that, unless we are unfortunate enough to run into another global pandemic, there will never be another one like it.

The Tigers have a postseason record of 15-18. They last played in a bowl game in 2018, losing to Oklahoma State in the Liberty Bowl. Missouri was not eligible for the postseason last year due to NCAA sanctions.\n\nDespite a disappointing end to the regular season, Missouri is going bowling. The 5-5 Tigers have accepted a bid to the Music City Bowl, where they will face Iowa, multiple sources have told PowerMizzou .\n\nIowa finished its shortened Big Ten-only schedule with six consecutive wins for a final record of 6-2. The Hawkeye offense has been led by running back Tyler Goodson, who gained 914 scrimmage yards and scored seven touchdowns in eight games. On the other side of the ball, the Hawkeyes are tied for seventh nationally in scoring defense, allowing an average of 16 points per game, and rank 13th in total defense.\n\nThe Music City Bowl will allow fans to attend, but will limit capacity. Ticket information can be found here.\n\nMissouri started Eli Drinkwitz's first season at the helm 0-2 with losses to Alabama and Tennessee but turned the season around by upsetting defending national champion LSU. That sparked a 5-1 run over the team's next six games, with the only loss coming at Florida. The Tigers ran out of steam at the finish line, however, losing 49-14 to Georgia on Dec. 12 then finishing the season with a 51-32 defeat at the hands of Mississippi State in Starkville.\n\nDue to the unusual and inconsistent schedules across the country caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the NCAA abolished record requirements for bowl games this season. However, several programs have opted not to participate in the postseason. Thirteen bowl games have been canceled, as well.\n\nBut Drinkwitz said last week that Missouri is committed to playing a bowl game. Even though all of the usual events and activities that normally accompany bowl games have been called off this year, he still views the experience as a reward.\n\nWe're excited about going bowling,\" Drinkwitz said. \"It's an awesome opportunity for our team to get a chance to continue this journey together and play another game. It's an awesome opportunity for Mizzou. ... Because of the type of season we had, it's a reward. You know, bowl games are still a reward for the season that you had, and we're going to choose to go for that, and excited about it.

On the other side of a narrow barrier, LSU\u2019s new No. 1 wide receiver stared into the cameras. He cocked back his head. He shrugged. He placed his hands on his hips and posed, embracing the attention.\n\nKayshon Boutte had scored his second touchdown against Ole Miss, solidifying his arrival as LSU\u2019s top target, and this came hours before his heroic game-winning score, before he carried LSU\u2019s offense and before he broke the LSU and Southeastern Conference single-game records for yards receiving with 308.\n\nNo player in LSU history had eclipsed 300 yards in one game. Boutte did it as a true freshman, breaking a school record held by Josh Reed since 2001.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good feeling knowing I set an SEC record as young as I am,\u201d said Boutte, an 18 year-old true freshman.\n\nLSU avoided the program\u2019s first losing record since 1999 with its 53-48 win Saturday largely because of Boutte, who shredded Ole Miss with deep and intermediate crossing routes. He broke the records on his 14th and final reception while playing through a twisted ankle.\n\nWith LSU trailing 48-46, Boutte caught a pass from quarterback Max Johnson, broke a tackle and maneuvered down the sideline. He barreled through Ole Miss players into the end zone for a 45-yard touchdown, his third of the game. Boutte sauntered toward the stands as his teammates mobbed him.\n\nBoutte didn\u2019t expect to have this kind of game as a true freshman. He assumed it would happen next year, once he adjusted to college football and built a deeper rapport with LSU\u2019s quarterbacks. But after LSU\u2019s older receivers opted out, Boutte wanted to become the team\u2019s No. 1 target.\n\nThe final three games of the season, Boutte recorded 27 catches, 527 yards and four touchdowns. He gained at least 100 yards in all three games, helping LSU\u2019s offense remain competitive without the players it expected to rely on entering the season.\n\nLSU knew Boutte was talented. He signed as a four-star prospect from New Iberia. Recruiting sites considered him the No. 1 wide receiver in Louisiana. But LSU opened preseason practice with reigning Biletnikoff Award winner Ja\u2019Marr Chase, junior Terrace Marshall and senior Racey McMath as its starting receivers. The day Chase opted out, Boutte had one of his best practices.\n\n\u201cThe best thing about Kayshon is his sure hands,\u201d coach Ed Orgeron said. \u201cAnything you throw him, he\u2019s going to catch.\u201d\n\nBoutte flashed at times as LSU\u2019s third or fourth option, but Marshall dominated the target share. Against Texas A&M in their final game together, Marshall finished with 10 catches for 134 yards while Boutte recorded nine yards on three receptions. Then Marshall opted out. So did tight end Arik Gilbert. And McMath was hurt.\n\n\u201cThe goal to myself was to be wide receiver one,\u201d Boutte said. \u201cThroughout the past three weeks, I worked hard in order to be that.\u201d\n\nIn LSU\u2019s next game, Boutte surpassed 100 yards for the first time.\n\nBoutte\u2019s emergence continued, but nothing predicted his performance against Ole Miss. Boutte gashed the Rebels as offensive coordinator Steve Ensminger used crossing routes as an adjustment to the coverage. All three of Boutte\u2019s touchdowns came on crossing routes.\n\nBoutte gained at least 15 yards on nine of his receptions, often catching the ball steps ahead of the defender. Johnson targeted him 20 times. He picked up 11 first downs, taking over the game as LSU funneled its offense through him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like the game in your hands,\u201d Boutte said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to complete your passes and make progress off it.\u201d\n\nLSU leaned on Boutte as it tried to regain the lead in the fourth quarter. He had six catches for 144 yards in the quarter.\n\nDown 48-40, Boutte pulled LSU to the goal line with receptions of 16 and 14 yards, pulling defenders to the 1-yard line as he twisted his ankle. Boutte hobbled off the field. Athletic trainers tapped his lower leg as Johnson leaped across the goal line to narrow the score. Boutte spent Ole Miss\u2019 next drive riding a stationary bike.\n\nBoutte stepped off the bike when LSU regained possession, trailing 48-46 with 2:36 left. He gained 7 yards on the first play. After a short run, Boutte lined up on the right side of the field. He already had 263 yards as he ran another crossing route.

Three-star all-purpose back Tychaun Chapman announced his commitment to the Tar Heels on Saturday, picking them over teams like Florida State, Alabama, Maryland, and Penn State.\n\nWHAT NORTH CAROLINA IS GETTING\n\nChapman is a bit undersized but has outstanding speed and very good ball skills. He\u2019ll line up primarily as a receiver at the next level and is particularly dangerous when he can get the ball with space to work. Chapman knows how to make defenders miss and should be a big contributor in the return game as well. Look for Chapman to add significant body mass before he sees consistent playing time.\n\nWHY IT'S BIG FOR THE TAR HEELS\n\nNorth Carolina will be looking for a replacement for Dazz Newsome and, in a few years, Joshua Downs and Chapman will likely fill that role. A speedy, versatile receiving target, Chapman should fit into this North Carolina offense nicely and he\u2019ll have a few years to get prepared. His commitment should help the Tar Heels continue to build momentum in Virginia too.

The offense didn't put up crazy numbers, but had a great game plan.\n\nLooking at the final score or the stat sheet might not give you the impression that the Seahawks had a particularly good day on offense, but in a lot of ways this was a great performance on that side of the ball.\n\nKnowing that Washington has one of the league's best pass rushes, the Seahawks, who were without starting right tackle Brandon Shell, relied on a short-passing game that didn't produce a lot of big plays, but did keep Russell Wilson upright. Washington, which starts four first-round picks on its defensive line, including Chase Young, the No. 2 pick in this year's draft, did not record a sack on Wilson and recorded only three quarterback hits.\n\nAnd while Seattle's offense stalled out in the second half, the Seahawks did score on four of their first five possessions to build a big lead, no small accomplishment against one of the league's top defenses.\n\nThe Seahawks also kept that pass rush at bay with a balanced attack featuring a steady dose of Chris Carson, a huge play from Carlos Dunlap, and even a long run by Wilson.\n\nAbout the only major negative for Seattle's offense came in the fourth quarter when Montez Sweat made a great play to deflect a Wilson pass, which was then intercepted by Daron Payne. Obviously the Seahawks want to avoid every turnover, but this particular one was more a case of two defensive players making a great play than a bad play by Wilson and offense.", "topic": "sports", "tag": "headline", "types": [], "claim": "", "verdict": ""}, {"url": "https://www.tsn.ca/alabama-clemson-ohio-state-notre-dame-earn-college-football-playoff-spots-1.1566720", "source": "tsn.ca", "authors": [], "title": "Alabama, Clemson, Ohio State, Notre Dame earn CFP spots - TSN", "pubDate": "2020-12-20T17:30:55+00:00", "description": "", "imageUrl": "https://www.tsn.ca/polopoly_fs/1.1402726!/fileimage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/mac-jones.jpg", "language": "en", "country": "ca", "content": "A college football season filled with uncertainty brought on by the pandemic will end with a perfectly predictable College Football Playoff.\n\nAlabama vs. Notre Dame. Clemson vs. Ohio State. Four of the the bluest of blue bloods and the teams that have comprised the top four in all the relevant rankings for nearly two months. Notre Dame was picked Sunday over Texas A&M for the final spot, ending what little drama there had been.\n\nThe top four teams in the selection committee's first rankings of the season were the same teams in a different order in the last. Alabama, Notre Dame, Clemson and Ohio State have held the first four spots in the AP Top 25 since Oct. 25.\n\nOnly 11 schools have ever reached the playoff and all four of the 2020 participants have been there before.\n\nThe Fighting Irish and Crimson Tide will meet Jan. 1 at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, after a late pandemic-related relocation from the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California. The Tigers and Buckeyes are set to play the same day at the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans \u2014 if all goes according to plan.\n\nThe national champion of this long and strange season is scheduled to be determined Jan. 11 at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida.\n\nThe Fighting Irish (10-1) are back in the playoff for the second time in three seasons, becoming the first team to lose a conference title game and make the final four. It was a novelty made possible only because of the pandemic, which pushed the famously independent Irish into a conference for the first time in school history.\n\nThe Atlantic Coast Conference is the second league to have two teams in the playoff, joining the SEC in 2017.\n\nAfter sitting second in the CFP rankings for a month, Notre Dame was blown out 34-10 by Clemson in the ACC championship. That opened the door for Texas A&M (8-1), which had been lurking in fifth, but was unable to become the third team in the playoff\u2019s seven-year history to make the field without even winning its conference division.\n\nSelection committee chairman Gary Barta, the Iowa athletic director, said Notre Dame's extra victory against a ranked opponent pushed the Irish over the top.\n\nNotre Dame beat Clemson and North Carolina, which had been 15th in the previous playoff rankings. Texas A&M's only victory against a team that was in the committee's ranking was Florida. The Aggies played Alabama in October and lost by 28 points.\n\nThe decision didn't go over well in Aggieland: Texas A&M quarterback Kellen Mond tweeted: \u201cJOKE\u201d The Aggies can take out their frustrations on North Carolina in the Orange Bowl on Jan. 2.\n\nBarta said Ohio State's six-game schedule wasn't much of an issue for the committee, overcome by the Buckeyes going undefeated and winning the Big Ten.\n\nOklahoma surged to sixth in the final rankings after closing with seven straight victories and a Big 12 title and will face seventh-place Florida in the Cotton Bowl on Dec. 30.\n\nUnbeaten Cincinnati finished eighth, making the Bearcats the top-ranked team among Group of Five conference champions and guaranteeing them a spot in one of the New Year's Six bowls. Cincinnati will meet Georgia in the Peach Bowl on New Year's Day.\n\nPac-12 champion Oregon will face Iowa State in the Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 2.\n\nNotre Dame's reward will be a matchup with Alabama (11-0), the Southeastern Conference champion that is back in the playoff for the sixth time after missing out last year. The last time the Fighting Irish and Crimson Tide played was the 2012 BCS championship game and the Tide won 42-14.\n\nClemson (10-1) is in for a sixth straight season, only missing out on the first playoff. Ohio State (6-0) is making its third appearance. The Tigers have won two playoff titles and the Buckeyes won the first after the 2014 season.\n\nClemson-Ohio State is a rematch of last season's dramatic semifinal in Arizona, won 29-23 by the Tigers. The two teams also met at the Fiesta Bowl in the 2016 playoff and Clemson beat the Buckeyes 31-0.\n\nOne of the semifinals was scheduled to be played at the Rose Bowl, but a move was announced Saturday night. The change was made after coaches and school officials from playoff contenders complained about California's COVID-19 restrictions that bans spectators from sporting events and would have made it impossible for players' families to attend the game.\n\nThe Rose Bowl twice asked for a special exemption from the state and was denied.\n\nPlaying the game at the home of the Dallas Cowboys will allow 16,000 fans to attend. Because of that, Barta said, the committee placed top-seeded Alabama there to give it the possibility of more of a home-field advantage.\n\nThe Superdome is currently set to have 3,000 fans for the Sugar Bowl, but that number could go up.\n\nThis season has been filled with disruptions as teams navigated COVID-19 outbreaks, contact tracing that sent players into extended quarantine and daily uncertainty about whether games will be played.\n\nOhio State had three regular-season games cancelled and the Big Ten had to change a minimum games played rule earlier this month just so the unbeaten Buckeyes could play in the conference title game Saturday against Northwestern.\n\nStill, 87% of the games scheduled were played.\n\nCollege Football Playoff executive director Bill Hancock has said a team selected to a semifinal would not be replaced if it could not play on the scheduled date. The game would be postponed if necessary and a every effort would be made to make it up.\n\nFollow Ralph D.

(AP) - Jin Young Ko missed most of the LPGA Tour season and still won the yearlong money title.\n\nThat's what a $1.1 million check does.\n\nKo, the No. 1 player in the world, put an emphatic capper on her truncated year Sunday by shooting a final-round 6-under 66 and winning the CME Group Tour Championship by five strokes over Hannah Green and Sei Young Kim.\n\n\"I still can't believe it, that I'm here, that I won this tournament,\" Ko said.\n\nWith a birdie on the final hole, the LPGA's final putt of the season, Ko finished at 18 under for her seventh career LPGA win. Green's final-round 67 - on her 24th birthday - helped push her into the second-place tie.\n\nKim, who took a one-shot lead into the final round, shot 72 and that was good enough for her to clinch Rolex Player of the Year honors. Danielle Kang won the Vare Trophy for the lowest scoring average.\n\n\"Feels like a pretty solid accomplishment in 2020, to be honest,\" Kang said.\n\nKo started the final round one shot back of Kim and opened with a birdie. The key stretch was Ko's run of three straight birdies on the 12th through the 14th - her longest such run of the week. She left a chance for a fourth in a row just left of the cup on 15, then all but wrapped up the win with another birdie on the 16th.\n\nThe win wrapped up a wire-to-wire year in the No. 1 spot for Ko, who has held the ranking since July 29, 2019. She moved to $5,600,824 in career earnings, making her the 71st player in LPGA history to cross the $5 million mark.\n\nHer approach Sunday was quite simple: \"I just (thought), OK, 18 holes left and then go to home,\" Ko said.\n\nShe's going back to South Korea as a winner, too.\n\nKo played only four LPGA events in 2020 - she competed six times on the Korean LPGA while riding out the coronavirus pandemic at home - but Sunday's win and a check for $487,286 for finishing second in last week's U.S. Women's Open helped push her season earnings to $1,667,925. That would have been good for fifth-best on tour last season, when each of the 21 leading money-winners all appeared in at least 20 events.\n\nKim's realistic hopes of winning ended when she left a 25-foot par putt short on the par-4 15th to fall four off Ko's lead. But the player-of-the-year award was still in her control at that point, and she finished that off.\n\nMina Harigae (68) finished at 12 under, the fourth-place finish matching the best of her LPGA career.\n\nLexi Thompson shot a 2-under 70 on Sunday and finished at 11 under, seven shots off the pace and tied with Lydia Ko for fifth. Thompson, the leader after Thursday's first round, saw her streak of consecutive seasons with at least one victory end at seven.\n\n\"Definitely a good ending to the year and to the week,\" said Thompson, the native South Floridian who had about 15 fans following her Sunday even though the tournament was technically closed to ticketholders.\n\nShe said she's looking forward to some normalcy in 2021.\n\n\"It was nice to have a few people out there supporting us,\" Thompson said. \"I think the fans make the game, so hopefully we'll get back to that in 2021.\"\n\nSunday marked the end to the 18-event LPGA season that was cut almost in half by the pandemic and was shut down for 5 1/2 months from mid-February through the end of July. Next season is scheduled for 34 events, starting with the Diamond Resorts Tournament of Champions in Lake Buena Vista, Florida, from Jan. 21-24.", "topic": "sports", "tag": "headline", "types": [], "claim": "", "verdict": ""}, {"url": "https://www.tsn.ca/toronto-raptors-sign-paul-watson-and-yuta-watanabe-1.1566721", "source": "tsn.ca", "authors": [], "title": "Raptors sign Watson and Watanabe - TSN", "pubDate": "2020-12-20T17:12:13+00:00", "description": "", "imageUrl": "https://www.tsn.ca/polopoly_fs/1.1428041!/fileimage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/paul-watson.jpg", "language": "en", "country": "ca", "content": "TORONTO \u2014 The Toronto Raptors have signed forwards Paul Watson and Yuta Watanabe.\n\nWatson and the Raptors agreed to terms on a standard NBA contract.

After all, there has been speculation he\u2019s a target for the team. Meanwhile, Anthony Duclair shoots down rumors of a three-year offer from the Ottawa Senators. The Washington Capitals need to make a trade or sign for a goaltender and which province is holding up a decision about the seven Canadian teams playing in Canada?\n\nFinally, there are some important dates and contracts changes the NHL released on Sunday.\n\nAccording to Joe Haggerty of Boston Hockey Now, there\u2019s not a whole lot of truth behind recent rumors that the Boston Bruins are close to signing Mike Hoffman. Haggerty believes the Bruins might be interested but doesn\u2019t believe there\u2019s a deal there unless Hoffman is willing to accept a one-year, $3.5 million contract.\n\nHoffman is reported to want at least a one-year deal starting at $5.5 million and Haggerty feels someone will pony up and give the winger at least $5 million for this coming season.\n\nSamantha Pell of The Washington Post recently said she expects the Washington Capitals to make a trade before the season begins. The team has a couple of needs they\u2019d like to address.\n\nSecond, the Capitals need to replace Henrik Lundqvist and add a goalie to comply with the new three goaltender change in the NHL\u2019s 2021 return to play guidelines.\n\nPell suggested Nick Jensen as a possible trade candidate but could be retained in case another defenseman is injured. Is it also possible the Capitals go after a player like Ryan Miller, Craig Anderson or Jimmy Howard in free agency.\n\nDuclair Shuts Down Rumor of 3-Yr Offer From Senators\n\nBruce Garrioch of the Ottawa Sun shared a tweet that came from Marc Brassard stating that forward Anthony Duclair denied ever being offer a three-year deal from the Ottawa Senators for far more money than Duclair eventually signed for in Florida.\n\nDuclair said he was surprised the Senators didn\u2019t qualify him and noted he was offered a one-year contract and turned it down. Duclair called the rumors of a three-year offer at $4.25 million laughable.\n\nProvince of B.C. The Hold Up For Canadian Teams?\n\nRyan Rishaug of TSN is reporting that a league source is saying that the province of British Columbus and their government is the thing holding up any NHL decision about whether or not teams can play in Canada of the seven clubs, including the Vancouver Canucks will need to move south of the border for the season.\n\nApparently, the province is not interested in having teams travel in to play games. Talks continue and things could change.\n\nThe NHL announced that entry-level contracts will slide on a prorated basis this season. Meaning, when 18 and 19 year old prospects play seven NHL games (versus 10 games played). a year comes off their entry-level slide.\n\nThis could affect players such as Los Angeles\u2019 Quinton Byfield, Winnipeg\u2019s Cole Perfetti, but also Toronto\u2019s Nick Robertson who is actively trying to make the Maple Leafs roster this season.\n\nIt was possible Robertson would get into 10 games anyways, but with the taxi squad, the chances of injury or illness in a COVID-season and fewer games needed, it seems clear that Robertson\u2019s contract will not slide into next season.\n\nThe NHL released the following changes for the NHL 2021 season and offseason on Sunday. There are some days and events to circle on your calendar:\n\nIf players want to voluntary opt-out of the season, they must provide written notice to their respective club at least seven days before training camp opens (so by Dec. 24 for the non-playoff teams and by Dec. 27 for the other 24 teams).\n\nTaxi squads for NHL rosters must include at least four players up to a maximum of six and there must be three goaltenders on the roster at all times (between the active roster and taxi squads).

Today, we look at the ideal three forwards, two defensemen and goalie to start a game for Russia.\n\nBure's 12 goals at the 1991 WJC are tied with Vladimir Ruzicka of Czechoslovakia (1983) for the second-most in one tournament, behind Markus Naslund of Sweden (13, 1993). Bure tied Jeremy Roenick of the United States for the World Juniors lead with eight goals in 1989, was named the tournament's best forward and helped the Soviet Union win the championship. Bure is the all-time leader in goals at the World Juniors and is third in points. He also helped the Soviet Union finish second to Canada in 1990 and 1991. Bure played 12 NHL seasons with three teams.\n\nMogilny was named the best forward at the 1988 WJC after he led the tournament in assists (10) and points (18), was second in goals (eight) and helped the Soviet Union finish second. He scored 12 points (seven goals, five assists) in seven games to help the Soviet Union win the 1989 WJC. Mogilny played 16 NHL seasons with four teams.\n\nOvechkin is tied for the fourth-most goals in WJC history, including a tournament-high seven in 2005 when he was named the best forward and helped Russia finish second. He also led the WJC with six goals in 2003 when Russia finished first. The left wing will play for the Washington Capitals this season, his 16th in the NHL.\n\nFetisov is the only player to be named best defenseman at the WJC twice, in 1977 and 1978, and helped the Soviet Union win the tournament all three years he played. He's the Russia/Soviet Union leader in points among defensemen at the World Juniors. Fetisov played nine NHL seasons with two teams.\n\nRomanov was named best defenseman at the 2019 WJC after he led the tournament with a plus-12 rating and led defensemen with eight points (one goal, seven assists) in seven games to help Russia finish third. He made the 2020 tournament all-star team after he scored six points (one goal, five assists) in seven games and helped Russia finish second. His 14 points are second to Fetisov among Russia/Soviet Union defensemen in the WJC. Romanov is expected to make his NHL debut with the Montreal Canadiens this season.\n\nBelosheikin is the winningest goalie in World Juniors history.

Both teams are 1-0 in Big Ten play.\n\nThe line opened at Rutgers -2 but has since gone down. There are a few important matchups to watch today, but current rosters and recent history shows value on the home team.\n\nThis Illinois team is driven by Ayo Dosunmu and Kofi Cockburn. They are the heart and soul of the Fighting Illini and the key to the team\u2019s success.\n\nHowever, they can also be Illinois\u2019 greatest weaknesses. Illinois is often over-reliant on its two stars. Baylor beat Illinois by limiting Cockburn to just seven points on four shots and Dosunmu to just 6-of-18 shooting.\n\nThe blueprint for beating Illinois is limiting those two as much as possible and putting pressure on their bench, which has been playing well, for the record. A well-rounded defensive team can throw multiple bodies at those two and restrict Illinois\u2019 offensive output.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to note that the Illinois offense has been spectacular this season. The Fighting Illini are sixth in the country in eFG% (60.1%) and 10th in 3-point shooting (43.2% on 17.9 attempts per game).\n\nAdditionally, Illinois is an excellent rebounding team. It is pulling down 44.7 total rebounds per game, which ranks 14th in the nation. In particular, Cockburn has been productive on the boards, averaging 9.4 boards per game.\n\nRutgers\u2019 road game against Maryland was a must-win if the Scarlet Knights were to establish themselves as a top-25 team. Steve Pikiell\u2019s team won by 14 and proved it belongs in the rankings.\n\nHowever, Illinois is not Maryland. The Terps lost their guard-big combo from last season in Jalen Smith and Anthony Cowan, while Illinois has one of the pairs in the country in Dosunmu and Cockburn.\n\nThe Scarlet Knight\u2019s success is built on their defense. Per KenPom, they rank 11th in defensive efficiency, and opponents are shooting just 42.6% from 2-point range and 28.3% from 3-point range.\n\nRon Harper Jr. has quickly become Rutgers\u2019 best player, having taken his game to a different level this season. After averaging 12.1 points and 5.8 rebounds per game last season, he\u2019s currently averaging 23.2 points and 7.0 rebounds per game.\n\nHarper is also Rutgers\u2019 most important player. In its game against Maryland, Rutgers gave up a 15-4 run to end the first half trailing by one point. Harper then scored 19 of his 27 total points in the second half, carrying Rutgers to a 14-point win. Whenever the Scarlet Knights needed a bucket, the ball went to Harper.\n\nRutgers also shares the ball well. It averages 19 assists per game, which ranks 23rd in the nation, and 60.2% of the Scarlet Knights\u2019 total field goals made are assisted. Senior point guard Jacob Young paces the team in assists, averaging six per game.\n\nFinally, the return of senior guard Geo Baker is welcomed by Scarlet Knights fans. After missing almost four full games due to injury, Baker came off the bench against Maryland to score 13 points on 5 of 13 shooting in 28 minutes. As a starter last season, Baker averaged 12.2 points and 4.1 assists per game.\n\nThere are two matchups that will decide the outcome of this game.\n\nFirst: the Rutgers defense against Illinois\u2019 two-headed monster. The Scarlet Knights will have to contain Dosunmu and Cockburn.\n\nHowever, I believe Rutgers is up to the task. The Scarlet Knights are an extremely adept defensive team and have the personnel to defend Cockburn on the interior and Dosunmu on the perimeter.\n\nSecond, Harper\u2019s offense against the Illinois defense will be crucial to the outcome. When Harper plays well, Rutgers wins.\n\nSyracuse is ranked 21st in defensive efficiency this season, three spots ahead of Illinois. Harper shredded that Syracuse defense for 26 points on 9-of-13 shooting with seven rebounds. The Scarlet Knights won by 10.\n\nIn Rutgers\u2019 most recent game against Illinois, on Feb. 15th, Harper scored 27 points on 11 of 14 shooting with six rebounds and two steals. Rutgers won by 15.\n\nGiven how he\u2019s playing this season, I\u2019ll take my chances with Harper today.\n\nFinally, recent history favors Rutgers in this spot. Per our SportsInsight Database, Rutgers is 13-6-2 against the spread as a home favorite since the 2017-18 season, yielding a 28% return on investment. Additionally, Rutgers has covered the spread the last three times it has played Illinois.\n\nI\u2019m banking on Harper and the Scarlet Knights\u2019 defense to outplay Illinois by playing Rutgers -1.", "topic": "sports", "tag": "headline", "types": [], "claim": "", "verdict": ""}, {"url": "https://www.deadlinedetroit.com/articles/26936/full-page_ny_times_ad_to_nba_if_black_lives_matter_what_are_you_doing_about_detroit_pistons_owner_tom_gores", "source": "deadlinedetroit.com", "authors": [], "title": "Full-Page NY Times Ad to NBA: 'If Black Lives Matter What Are You Doing About Detroit Pistons Owner Tom Gores?' - Deadline Detroit", "pubDate": "2020-12-20T14:07:00+00:00", "description": "", "imageUrl": "https://d2nyfqh3g1stw3.cloudfront.net/photos/featured_Gores_Pistons_Postcard_side_1_46447.png", "language": "en", "country": "ca", "content": "Photo on online petition to get rid of Gores.\n\nA full-page ad in the Sunday New York Times asks NBA Commissioner Adam Silvers and team owners: \"If Black Lives Matter, What are You Doing About Detroit Pistons Owner Tom Gores?\"\n\nThe ad, which appears on page 33 of the national edition, is sponsored by a non-profilt prison organization, Worth Rises, that is protesting Gores's Beverly Hills private equity firm, Platinum Equity, which owns one of the nation\u2019s largest prison telecom corporations, Securus. It accuses the firm of predatory pricing for prisoner phone calls that particularly harms families of color.\n\nThe the group, describes itself as being dedicated to dismantling the prison industry and ending the exploitation of those it touches.\n\nIn an online petition titled \"Demand the NBA Force Tom Gores to Sell the Detroit Pistons,\" the group writes:\n\nSecurus rakes in more than $700 million annually by price-gouging families \u2014 disproportionately Black, Brown, and low-income \u2014 struggling to connect and support incarcerated loved ones. The corporation routinely charges as much as $15 for a simple 15-minute phone call, and piles on sky high deposit fees, among others. Securus then pays correctional administrators and sheriffs millions in kickbacks every year. As a result of Securus\u2019 predatory practices, which Tom Gores has authorized, one in three families goes into debt trying to stay connected to a loved one behind bars, and 87 percent of the people carrying that burden are women, largely women of color. While advocates around the country have fought to stop Securus from exploiting families, Gores has done little to help those his decisions have harmed. For our part at Worth Rises, we delivered our demands to Tom in March of 2019 with deadline of end of year 2020 to divest from Securus. We then spent nearly a year in conversation with Gores and his team to no avail. And in January, Gores cancelled a meeting with directly impacted families.\n\nThe petition goes on to say:\n\nHe is a prison profiteer who has no place on the board of one of our nation\u2019s favorite cultural institutions: the NBA. Gores should not be allowed to whitewash his active exploitation of marginalized communities by simply asserting that Black Lives Matter, especially in the U.S. city with the highest percentage of Black residents. Gores has to go!\n\nA Pistons spokesman Sunday morning referred comment to Platnum Equity spokesman Dan Whelan. He did not immediately respond for comment.\n\nIn June, after the death of George Floyd, Gores released a statement in support of the Black Lives Matter movement:\n\nThe protests that have unfolded across our country over the last week and the senseless deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor shine a piercing light on issues of racism, police brutality and inequitable justice that continue to divide our country. As an organization, we condemn those things. But words aren\u2019t enough.

Since joining the Blue Jays midway through 2019, the Lebanon, Pennsylvania native has slashed .194/.286/.376 with seven home runs and 19 RBI\u2019s in 56 games with his new organization.\n\nKnown for his speed and athleticism when with the Astros, Fisher\u2019s debut with the Blue Jays started a bit rocky, he took a fly ball off the face in just his third game with the organization. He would have to leave the game the same day Sanchez and Biagini would help solidify a combined no-hitter for the Astros.\n\nIn 2020, Fisher would play in 16 games for the Blue Jays in the COVID shortened season and would slash .226/.359/.452 with one home run, seven RBI\u2019s, and no stolen bases. He would also finish the season on the injured list after taking a pitch to his knee during a batting practice session on September 15th.\n\nWhile Fisher is out of minor league options and would need to make the roster out of spring training or be exposed to waivers (if sent down to AAA), the outfielder\u2019s stats might not scream \u2018trade bait\u2019 at first glance. The one major plus Fisher has going for him is that he hasn\u2019t hit his arbitration years and a change of scenery could help a team looking for an outfielder with years of control and some MLB experience under their belt.\n\nIf the Blue Jays do acquire a veteran outfielder this off-season via free agency, there may not be room for Fisher on the roster, which could see him being shipped out of town before trying to pass him through the waiver wire at the start of the season instead of potentially losing him for nothing.", "topic": "sports", "tag": "headline", "types": [], "claim": "", "verdict": ""}, {"url": "https://www.shoot.co.uk/three-players-arsenal-could-sign-in-january-after-poor-premier-league-season-continues-at-everton/", "source": "shoot.co.uk", "authors": [], "title": "Three players Arsenal could sign in January after poor Premier League season continues at Everton - Shoot", "pubDate": "2020-12-20T21:39:00+00:00", "description": "Three players Arsenal could sign in January after poor Premier League season continues at Everton", "imageUrl": "https://cdn.shoot.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2020-12-19T193640Z_1910166787_UP1EGCJ1IH4PD_RTRMADP_3_SOCCER-ENGLAND-EVE-ARS-REPORT.jpg", "language": "en", "country": "gb", "content": "Arsenal\u2019s terrible 2020/21 Premier League season continued as they were beaten 2-1 by Everton at Goodison Park.\n\nMikel Arteta\u2019s side\u2019s fifth defeat in seven winless matches means they sit 15th in the table on 14 points from as many matches.\n\nThat\u2019s just four points clear of the bottom-three and 12 points off a top-four place they would\u2019ve been aiming to reach at the start of the campaign.\n\nSo despite a promising start to his Arsenal reign, which delivered both FA Cup and Community Shield success a few months ago, the pressure is now firmly on Arteta to turn the situation around.\n\nThe North London club will also have an eye on the January transfer window with fresh blood desperately needed.\n\nBut who could the Gunners move to sign next month? We take a look at three players Arsenal have been linked with in recent days\u2026\n\nAccording to reports from Italian outlet Calcio Mercato, Arsenal are planning to move for Slavia Prague forward Abdallah Sima to create further competition in what is an underperforming forward line. The 19-year-old has scored 13 goals in all competitions this term for the Czech side. Sima, who mostly plays as a central striker but can play out wide, is also thought to be interesting West Ham.\n\nDespite being relegated last season, Emi Buendia certainly showed he certainly had the class to play in the top-flight. In December 2019, the midfielder actually created the most chances (29) in a calendar month on record in Premier League history. Now having played a few months back in the Championship, the Argentine could be set to depart in January, according to Sky Sports. Arsenal were reportedly previously linked with Buendia so it remains to be seen if they renew that in the new year.\n\nBrighton have won just two of their 14 matches this term but Yves Bissouma has been a shining light in their midfield. The Mali international\u2019s energy and skill has often baffled opposition players. Bissouma\u2019s performances have according to his agent Michael N\u2019Cho (as reported by Jonathan Shrager) caught the eye of Arsenal. However, it\u2019s also thought that Manchester United, Liverpool, Monaco and two La Liga teams are interested in the 24-year-old.", "topic": "sports", "tag": "headline", "types": [], "claim": "", "verdict": ""}, {"url": "https://www.theargus.co.uk/sport/18958144.graham-potter-thought-albion-deserved/", "source": "theargus.co.uk", "authors": ["Adam Stenning"], "title": "Graham Potter thought Albion deserved more - The Argus", "pubDate": "2020-12-20T15:28:00+00:00", "description": "Graham Potter was disappointed that Albion came away\u00a0with only a point\u00a0after their 1-1 draw against Sheffield United.", "imageUrl": "https://www.theargus.co.uk/resources/images/12138779/", "language": "en", "country": "gb", "content": "Albion head coach Graham Potter was disappointed that his side only came away with a point after their 1-1 draw against Sheffield United.\n\nThe Seagulls played for over 50 minutes with a man advantage after John Lundstram was sent off in the first half for his challenge on Joel Veltman.\n\nDespite their man advantage the Seagulls went behind courtesy of Jaydon Bogle\u2019s deflected strike.\n\nBut in the 87th minute, substitute Danny Welbeck rescued a point for the Seagulls.\n\nHowever, Potter thought his side deserved more.\n\nHe said: \u201cWell, I think we started the game well, I thought we played really well for the first 30 minutes.\n\n\u201cThey had to make a tactical change because we were so dominant, we had a chance with Neal and the constant pressure from corners and I thought we were the better team.\n\n\u201cI think the red card then changes the complexion of the game as it becomes a bit more defense versus attack and the onus is on us.\n\n\"We were then caught with the sucker punch in terms of the breakaway.\n\n\u201cWe had chances in the second half as well.

Some supporters have been left feeling disconnected with the team due to some of their recent performances.\n\nWhether it\u2019s true or not, there\u2019s been a sense that the Celtic players had downed tools. It would certainly explain some of the bizarre results in recent months such as the two 4-1 losses to Sparta Prague, or the 1-1 home draw vs St Johnstone. How else do you explain the 2-0 Betfred Cup defeat to Ross County too?\n\nBut Lennon has moved to dismiss any fears of that ahead of today\u2019s Scottish Cup final vs Hearts. He\u2019s revealed to supporters some of the positive things he\u2019s noticed at Lennoxtown as he bigs up his team.\n\nAs quoted by the Herald, Lennon said: \u201cIt\u2019s certainly different, all the furore and meeting people in the street, it\u2019s a lot calmer,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely been a sign of anticipation in the training and the body language this week. The players seem to be a lot more engaged and a lot more together, which is great.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I need to (explain the severity of the game to them), because I think the players are completely aware of what the gravity of the game is. A lot of them have won three Trebles and they don\u2019t take it for granted. We know how difficult it is to win a trophy.\u201d\n\nHave there been things wrong at the Celtic training base recently?\n\nThese comments are interesting from Lennon.\n\nSure, it\u2019s great to see that the players are fired up for today. We need that because as well as an historic quadruple treble, we need to keep building on recent momentum. The fact their body language is looking good should reflect well on the performance.\n\nHowever, whether Lennon realises it or not here, he\u2019s opened the door a little too far. It\u2019s clear from these comments that there have been problems at Lennoxtown in recent weeks. Were the players less engaged in recent weeks? Was there a lack of togetherness in the dressing room?\n\nThat\u2019s what the manager is pointing to here. These things will never truly be revealed with everything kept in-house, but it would only back up supporters who questioned the lack of effort.\n\nThere can be no more of that in the coming weeks.

Now they just have to keep it going.\n\nNoble's relationship with Notts supporters may have soured as a result of some of his social media antics during their relegation to the National League, but there's no disputing his ability.\n\nThe midfielder, who is now playing for Morpeth, caught the eye with a glorious 40-yard pass on a ridiculously heavy pitch which underlined the quality he still possesses in his right foot.\n\nFormer Notts manager Ricardo Moniz once said that Noble \"does not know how good he can be\" and he was a player the Dutchman felt could have played in the Championship.\n\nNo Notts fan will forget the amazing 40-yard lob he scored in a stunning win at Championship Huddersfield in the League Cup a few years back and at that stage you felt a big move was only around the corner.\n\nYet here he is playing in part-time football in non-league and it's as surprising as it is sad that a player blessed with so many good attributes is not showcasing that talent at a much higher level.\n\nThere were obvious questions about his temperament when he was at Notts due a series of red cards, but he looks to have matured and still retains that eye for a pass that you just can't teach.\n\nAt 29 there is still one move left in him and there's no doubt he is far better than the level he is currently playing at.\n\nThe on-loan Barnsley midfielder has not had many opportunities to impress since arriving at Meadow Lane through no fault of his own.\n\nWolfe was one of the players to have contracted Covid, but he did so just as Notts were returning from their three-week break meaning he had to undergo an extra 10 days in isolation.\n\nThe form of Michael Doyle and Jake Reeves, which has been instrumental in carrying Notts up to third in the National League table, has meant Wolfe has had to be incredibly patient.\n\nBut he was given a start against Morpeth where his performance demonstrated why he is so highly-rated by the Tykes. He showed some lovely touches, passed with authority but also proved he loves a tackle.\n\nHe was certainly one of the players who must be pushing for a start in Ardley's side with the Notts boss admitting he has been seriously impressed with what he has seen from him in training.\n\nWith such a busy festive programme ahead of Notts, to have a player of his quality champing at the bit is a wonderful headache for Neal Ardley to have.\n\nThere are a number of clubs in the National League and much higher in the professional game that could learn a thing or two from the hospitality shown by Notts' opponents.\n\nFirst of all Stephen Turnbull apologised for the state of the pitch, but the Morpeth chairman had nothing to be sorry for. A huge deluge of rain in the north east the day previous meant it was incredibly heavy, but the club did wonders to get the game on.\n\nIt was a fine gesture but it was not the only touch of class shown by the Northern Premier League side.\n\nWith the press based outside and most having to stand and watch the game, they had to withstand a second-half downpour meaning hi-tech equipment was battered by a wave of watery bullets.\n\nMorpeth's response was to order a few pizzas for the media as a way of making amends when, again, there was nothing they could do about mother nature.\n\nIt was a really lovely touch and most appreciated by all the visiting journalists.\n\nThey couldn't have been more hospitable.\n\nIn terms of priorities the FA Trophy does not figure highly on Notts' ambitions, but they now find themselves in the fourth round after a fine performance in difficult conditions.\n\nArdley has used the Trophy to rotate his squad and we can expect more of the same this season.\n\nBut given the depth not to mention the quality of the squad, you would fancy Notts to have another good run in the competition.\n\nThey reached the semi-final last season but unfortunately had to play that game as part of their pre-season campaign against a Harrogate side who were weeks ahead in terms of fitness as the EFL campaign had already started.\n\nThat felt a little unfair on Notts, but they sucked it up and got on with it.\n\nIt would be fitting if they could go one better this season just to give their fans a day out at Wembley. A home draw in Monday's fourth round would be most welcome.", "topic": "sports", "tag": "headline", "types": [], "claim": "", "verdict": ""}, {"url": "https://www.neowin.net/news/oddworld-new-n-tasty-is-free-to-claim-on-the-epic-games-store-today/", "source": "neowin.net", "authors": [""], "title": "Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty is free to claim on the Epic Games Store today - Neowin", "pubDate": "2020-12-18T16:30:00+00:00", "description": "The second day of Epic Games Store's daily freebie promotion is offering Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty to claim.

But what about those lesser-known gems we often forget about? We all have our go-to holiday favourites \u2014 everything from It\u2019s a Wonderful Life to Home Alone. But what about those other seasonal movies that don\u2019t get the same attention we give to others around this time of year? There\u2019s a wealth of other holiday-set movies out there \u2014 so many, in fact, that we often forget they exist. For those looking to try something new this year, we took some of your all-time best holiday picks and paired them with an equally enjoyable alternative.\n\nIf you love: It\u2019s A Wonderful Life (1946)\n\n Try: The Bishop\u2019s Wife (1947) or The Preacher\u2019s Wife (1996) Frank Capra\u2019s 1946 gem It\u2019s a Wonderful Life is a holiday staple: Christmas just isn\u2019t Christmas unless you\u2019ve watched George Bailey (Jimmy Stewart) joyously running through the snow. It\u2019s also the rare holiday flick that earned itself a trip to the Academy Awards with five Oscar nominations, including Best Picture. With a premise that pulls some of its themes of redemption from A Christmas Carol, a suicidal George Bailey is shown (with the help of an angel) what life would have been like had he never existed. Its heartwarming climax could warm even the grinchiest of Grinches. In keeping with the idea of kindly angels who miraculously arrive in time to help humans sort out their earthly business, we also have The Bishop\u2019s Wife. Released close on the heels of It\u2019s a Wonderful Life, this film often gets lost in the holiday shuffle. But we think any movie that features the always-charming Cary Grant as an angel (named Dudley, no less) who helps a bishop repair his fractured marriage just in time for Christmas is a must-watch.\n\nAnd, in a similar vein to The Bishop\u2019s Wife, there\u2019s the popular 1996 remake, The Preacher\u2019s Wife. This time around, Reverend Henry Biggs (Courtney B. Vance) is the charming pastor of a small struggling Baptist church in a New York City neighbourhood. With membership declining and bills piling up, Henry is under pressure from real estate developer Joe Hamilton (Gregory Hines) to sell the church\u2019s assets. As a result, Henry has become neglectful of his wife, Julia (Whitney Houston), and their son. Henry, in a moment of desperation, prays to God for help, which comes in the form of Dudley (Denzel Washington), a witty angel. This charmer, directed by Penny Marshall, was an instant holiday classic.\n\nIf you love: Scrooge (1951, or any of the other countless adaptations)\n\n Try: 3 Godfathers (1948) When it comes to A Christmas Carol, you can take your pick of the litter as to which adaptation is your favourite. (But can anyone really top Alastair Sim in the lead role of the 1951 version, Scrooge? Unlikely.) At last count, there are at least a whopping 46 screen incarnations of the Charles Dickens classic, be it TV specials, silent movies, short films or big screen adaptations. It\u2019s hard not to love watching Ebenezer Scrooge find love, respect and a renewed purpose in life, just in time for the chiming bells on Christmas morning.\n\nIf, however, you\u2019re looking to change it up a little this year? Pair your annual screening of A Christmas Carol with this under-the-radar John Wayne western, set during the holiday season. Loosely based on the story of the Three Wise Men, this John Ford film follows three bank robbers, led by Wayne, as they struggle to safely cross the desert with an orphaned newborn baby whose life they saved. Watching three criminals rally together \u2014 and better themselves in the process \u2014 to protect the life of an infant is heartwarming to watch.\n\nIf you love: White Christmas (1954)\n\n Try: Babes in Toyland (1934 or 1961) Nothing rings in the holiday season better than Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye, Rosemary Clooney and Vera-Ellen gathered together at the lodge in Pine Tree to sing \u201cSnow\u201d and \u201cWhite Christmas.\u201d With catchy songs written by the legendary Irving Berlin, vibrant costumes and exciting choreography, White Christmas is often heralded as the must-watch holiday musical. If you want to keep your toes tapping, follow up a viewing of White Christmas with one of the big screen adaptations of Babes in Toyland. Whether you prefer the 1934 Laurel and Hardy original or the candy-coloured 1961 Disney version, the films both centre around Mother Goose and other popular nursery rhyme characters as they scramble to help the Toymaker get Santa\u2019s gift order right in time for Christmas Eve.\n\nYou wouldn\u2019t think \u201cChristmas\u201d and \u201ccourt proceedings\u201d would go hand-in-hand when it comes to fun and wholesome family entertainment, but this holiday classic is anything but dull and dreary. Starring a pint-sized Natalie Wood as Susan Walker and Edmund Gwenn as old Kris Kringle, much of the setting takes place inside a courtroom as Mr. Kringle defends himself against accusations that he\u2019s insane for believing he\u2019s the real Santa Claus. There\u2019s no denying Miracle on 34th Street is a real heart-warmer. However, Miracle isn\u2019t the only holiday film about a family embracing a complete stranger. Jim Bullock (Don DeFore) is a homeless New Yorker who has made quite a career for himself breaking into rich people\u2019s homes to squat on their property while they\u2019re away for Christmas. When the \u201cworld\u2019s second-wealthiest man\u201d (Charles Ruggles) leaves town, Jim takes over his mansion and gradually invites some of his fellow homeless friends to live with him and celebrate Christmas \u2014 until his plans are suddenly interrupted by the unexpected arrival of the owner.\n\nIf you love: Love, Actually (2003)\n\n Try: The Shop Around The Corner (1940) Love, Actually is one of the more recent holiday classics, and it\u2019s replayed endlessly on TV during the month of December. With its huge ensemble cast, from Hugh Grant to Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman to Liam Neeson, it has no shortage of star power. Each character (and there are a lot of them) has their own dilemma that is neatly resolved at the end \u2014 just in time for Christmas! \u2014 and we dare you not to reach for a tissue during the finale. Much like some of the storylines in Love, Actually, this underrated Jimmy Stewart film revolves around two people unwittingly falling in love during the holiday season. Klara Novak (Margaret Sullavan) and Alfred Kralik (Jimmy Stewart) are two gift shop employees who can\u2019t stand one another. Little do they know, they\u2019re actually falling in love through letters as each others\u2019 anonymous pen pal. Think: You\u2019ve Got Mail (1998) in the days when snail mail was the main mode of written communication.\n\nAlthough this one likely won\u2019t appeal to the kids in your life, Remember the Night also involves the silly antics of robbers and shoplifters \u2014 albeit a little less villainous than the Home Alone goons. Just before Christmas, Lee Leander (Barbara Stanwyck) is charged with her third shoplifting offence. Since it\u2019s difficult to set a trial date around Christmastime, her lawyer (Fred MacMurray) shows some sympathy for her plight and arranges for her bail and takes her home to his family for the holidays. Inevitably, love soon follows.\n\nIf you love: Meet Me in St. Louis (1944)\n\n Try: Holiday Inn (1942) In this rousing Vincente Minelli musical, the four Smith daughters (led by Judy Garland) learn lessons about life and love as they reluctantly prepare for their family\u2019s move to New York. Taking place over the span of a year, the final quarter of the film is set during the celebratory days of the Christmas holidays and includes Garland\u2019s beautiful rendition of \u201cHave Yourself a Merry Little Christmas.\u201d Sure, it\u2019s only one-fourth of a holiday movie, but it\u2019s so wonderfully magical that it\u2019ll leave you feeling warm and fuzzy on the inside. Much like St. Louis, the underrated musical Holiday Inn takes place over the span of 365 days \u2014 beginning and ending during the Christmas season. This Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire charmer also includes Crosby\u2019s iconic version of \u201cWhite Christmas\u201d \u2014 nearly a decade before he sang it again in White Christmas. Set in an inn, a crooner and a dancer both vie for the attention of a beautiful rising ingenue (Marjorie Reynolds). It\u2019s a funny, romantic and memorable crowd-pleaser that often gets left by the wayside compared to other holiday fare.", "topic": "entertainment", "tag": "headline", "types": [], "claim": "", "verdict": ""}, {"url": "https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2020/12/20-1/dragon-ball-fighterz-shows-gt-some-love-with-super-baby-2-dlc", "source": "crunchyroll.com", "authors": ["Joseph Luster"], "title": "Dragon Ball FighterZ Shows GT Some Love with Super Baby 2 DLC - Crunchyroll News", "pubDate": "2020-12-20T14:34:33+00:00", "description": "&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFollowing up on an early announcement in the pages of Jump, Bandai Namco and Arc System Works revealed the latest plans for Dragon Ball FighterZ during a Jump Festa 2021 Online stage eve", "imageUrl": "https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire2/f25a4b065b728fa3329aa2fec323ee621608474827_thumb.jpg", "language": "en", "country": "ca", "content": "Following up on an early announcement in the pages of Jump, Bandai Namco and Arc System Works revealed the latest plans for Dragon Ball FighterZ during a Jump Festa 2021 Online stage event.

a healthy person's blood oxygen levels are between 95 to 100 per cent.\n\n\"As a nurse, I have never seen someone walking and talking with an oxygen saturation level of just 44 per cent.\n\n\"We had only been in the ER for probably one hour when doctors decided they needed to put him on a ventilator.\"\n\nStephanie never expected that her son would not be leaving hospital.\n\nWhile Peyton suffered from a thyroid problem and had asthma, she did not consider him particularly at risk from the respiratory infection.\n\n\"I was scared he was going to be put on a ventilator but I also thought we'll get over this hump and bring him home.\"\n\nDoctors treated Peyton with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) where blood is temporarily removed from the body to allow artificial oxygenation of the red blood cells and the removal of carbon dioxide.\n\nHis condition worsened suddenly on Saturday 31 October when he began to haemorrhage.\n\n\"He had this big coughing fit and he basically started to haemorrhage in his chest.\n\n\"The surgeons were trying to replace the ECMO and they were doing CPR to help circulate his blood because his pulse was so weak and his oxygen levels were so low.\"\n\nAs doctors desperately tried to replace the ECMO tubes in Peyton's neck, the blood that had pooled in his chest sprayed over the walls.\n\nStephanie said: \"It was all over the cardiothoracic surgeon and he just kept working.\"\n\nStephanie, who had been granted special permission to be in the hospital as she had Covid, watched as 10 nurses and four doctors battled for an hour and 15 minutes to save her son's life before calling the time of death.\n\n\"Never did I ever think this was going to happen,\" Stephanie said.\n\n\"You don't hear about kids getting Covid and it being that serious.\n\n\"I was just in shock.\n\n\n\n Adding to Stephanie's pain, her sister Cyndi, a trauma registrar, came down with Covid a week before thanksgiving.\n\nShe was also put on a ventilator and received ECMO but she passed away on December 7.\n\n\"Every day is a struggle to get out of bed and go through the motions,\" Stephanie said.\n\nShe shared that the only positive has been reuniting with her ex boyfriend, Chris Lottmann, 43, a welder, whom Peyton adored.\n\n\"He was very close with Peyton and I called him to tell him that Peyton had passed away and he was devastated.\n\n\"We have got back together and he has been a huge source of support for me and he has been here for me every moment that I've needed it.\n\n\"We think it was Peyton's wish and our gift from Peyton that he got us back together - he really didn't want us to break up in the first place.\"\n\nStephanie paid tribute to her son, saying that he had made more friends in his 13 years than some people make in a lifetime.\n\n\"He was the sweetest boy and he made everyone smile.\n\n\"In his 13 years of life, he made more friends than someone would make if they lived to 85.\"\n\nStephanie is speaking out about her son's death in the hopes that it will make Americans take Covid seriously and follow health guidelines.\n\n\"I hope people will take Covid more seriously and not say it is a political agenda or some type of fakes news or that it is the same as the flu.\"\n\n\"We were so very careful,\" she said.\n\n\"If we ever went anywhere, we always wore masks and we always washed our hands and used hand sanitiser and we still got Covid.\n\n\"Our hearts go out to all the healthcare providers who are battling this on the front lines everyday.\"\n\nThe Chief Medical Officer at SSM Health Cardinal Glennon Children's Hospital, Dr. Marya Strand said: \"Despite the recent availability of vaccines, it is clear that our communities will need to continue to use appropriate caution and preventive measures to protect vulnerable populations.\n\n\"Masking, vigilant hand hygiene and physical distancing are the pillars of prevention during this pandemic.

As he contemplates the supreme effort that will be required he was sent positive messages on the French Vendee Globe Live show by the godfather of his boat, Swiss-French Formula 1 driver Romain Grosjean, who himself survived a horror crash, stepping from the fireball wreck of his car three weeks ago.\n\n\"Each morning I get up and check where he is and follow his race really closely and have been following all the issues he has had to deal with. If I can send you Louis a bit of my autopilot help it is going to you. I do not like electronics, and do not know how to manage that, I know you will repair though, and I hope you will find the electronics solutions you need and that you can climb back the fleet up like you did at the start of the race.\" Grosjean said today, adding \" I share something special with Kevin Escoffier in that we have both recently survived very difficult moments. I think everyone was amazed to see me come out of the flames of my burning car after 28 seconds. And so was everyone happy to hear that Jean Le Cam was able to rescue Kevin Escoffier in what was terrible conditions and that he is safe and sound.\"\n\nIn 13th place Romain Attanasio had nine hours of hard work including some precision engineering to fix part of his mainsail track which had meant he could not drop his mainsail into a reef.\n\nThe second time on the Vendee Globe is not necessarily better than the first. Indeed great expectations and some deep disappoinrments have certainly hampered Alan Roura and Stephane Le Diraison during the first half of their respective races this time. The first time is always an adventure and the second inevitably is about a higher level of performance and competitiveness.\n\nLe Diraison most of all is looking forwards to successfully passing Cape Leeuwin under Australia. he dismasted on the last edition and needed two weeks to limp under jury rig to Melbourne. Roura has upgraded his boat to a newer, faster Finot Conq design with foils. Both are now looking forwards to the second half of their races with a better sense of perspective and self-knowledge.\n\nAlain Roura, the Swiss skipper who is the youngest in the fleet at 29 and who is on his second Vendee Globe is much more content in himself now that he is not mentally beating himself up all the time. He has softened a mindset which was measuring himself all the time against other boats, worrying all the time about how fast he should be going. Instead he is now entirely focused on his world inside the guardrails of La Fabrique, looking after his boat and enjoying making it go fast.\n\n\"The first time I was here was to realise an adventure, a dream and to take a lot of pleasures. And I think at the beginnning of this race I was just too much in racing mode, pushing the boat and too much focussed on beating the others. I forgot what the Vendee Globe is about and so I had changed a bit my mind, my way of sailing and now how I am going to do the second half of the race. And I think we never stop learning on the Vend\u00e8e Globe. That is a good point. I maybe was not me on the first half of the race and now I will try to be the Alan I know, the Alan that can sail fast and be totally crazy and not thinking about the others and just make my course because of the others. I want to do my course and sail well. That is the difference between the first and the second Vend\u00e8e Globe. I am learning what kind of sailor I am.\n\nI am a competitor I am a racer but I am supposed to push as hard as I can for the conditions I have where I am and not think about the others. I am a sailor first and foremost, who needs to take care of himself and his boat. And I love to sail fast and take pleasure from that.\"\n\nAnd Le Diraison, who is 16th, just over 400 miles behind behind 14th placed Roura, says the essence of the race is to treat each day as a personal challenge,\n\n\"It is very different. I thought it would be easier but in fact it is much harder.\" he said today of the comparision between his two races, \" I was so desperate to manage this race and go very fast I ended up disappointed to lose the head of the race so soon thanks to problems on my boat and then because of the weather conditions. I had no wind in the South Atlantic and the beginning of the South Indian. It is definitely very different this time. But it will be new after Cape Leeuwin as last time I dismasted and had to stop into Melbourne. I am very excited to discover the second half of the race. On the first part I compared too much and so now I am looking forwards to the second half.\n\nI am very happy to be here to reach to Les Sables d'Olonne and to give your best that is what is important of course. But it is about the personal challenge, every day to give your best every day.\"\n\nClarisse Cremer, Banque Populaire X: \"Yesterday I slept because I was wiped out. I think I'm sensitive to the time changes and to knowing when it's morning. So, I eat when can, but I don't know where I am, it's a bit of a mess. I know that I sleep better at night, but if I have to gybe, like last night, I don't deprive myself. I like to know that I give myself a four-hour window to eat and sleep well. It's hard for me to set a schedule now. It's nothing serious, but I hadn't anticipated this too much. The weather is complicated, I'm tying myself up in knots. It's not easy to know if I should slow down, to let the heart of the depression coming from the north pass by, or if I should try to keep ahead. I'm waiting for the latest weather files.\"\n\nThomas Ruyant, LinkedOut: \"All is going a bit better. It was a tough thing to manage and now it is behind me. I had a bit of trouble yesterday trying to dry out the boat particularly because I was so tired but have managed to sleep a bit and get back on course, the right course this time! The race continues and I see it as yet another obstacle to have managed on the journey to the Sables.\n\nHaving had to stop the boat and head northwards a bit, an option was there that could have been interesting to catch up with the leaders but unfortunately it shut down sooner with an area of calm than I had expected and so, unfortunately, I was not able to make it happen. I gambled maybe more than is normal and was possibly preoccupied with the issues on board and had not spent enough time to really analyse the option.\n\nI had to catch up and lean a bit on the strategic option to try and limit the damage, but now I am not that far from the leaders. I can't hang about though because conditions are complex with a new area of high pressure developing to the North of us and which should move south-eastwards, so we need to be quick to try and slip under it and not get caught in the light conditions, which is the danger we face in the coming 48 hours.\"\n\n1.

Sign up now!\n\n1. Three teams will miss the top eight after playing finals in 2020\n\nThat sounds bold, but based on history, it\u2019s a safe bet. We had just two changes between the 2019 and 2020 finalists (Port Adelaide and St Kilda in, GWS and Essendon out), but that was below the trend since the top eight was introduced in 1994. Since then, we\u2019ve averaged around 2.8 changes a year and there\u2019s always been at least two \u2013 so more often than not, almost half the eight will change. Who goes this time? Collingwood will be a common pick after their disastrous trade period while as elimination final losers, while the Western Bulldogs would be the next-most obvious selection. Or could St Kilda suffer some second-year blues under Brett Ratten?\n\n2, 3 and 4. And their replacements will be \u2026\n\nMelbourne. The Demons are the easiest pick of the bottom ten to return to September \u2013 their percentage of 107.8 (better than the Bulldogs recorded) showed they were good enough. They just happened to throw away their chances with those awful losses to the Swans and Dockers up in Cairns. They only missed by two premiership points in the end. With another year of development, and with Simon Goodwin coaching for his career, they\u2019ll prove their list isn\u2019t just good on paper.\n\nCarlton. Bluebaggers have been desperate to see their side return to finals footy and the team has been building very nicely ever since David Teague took over. After six wins under the coach in 2019, and a 7-10 record in 2020 (including two losses by less than a goal), expectations are starting to build. And it\u2019s clear the team is aiming to win now after a big trade period that saw them add stars Zac Williams and Adam Saad. Not having Charlie Curnow from the start of the season will hurt, but there\u2019s enough talent here now for a finals berth.\n\nSydney. Yes, they finished 16th, but did you see their injury list? It was longer than Gill McLachlan\u2019s COVID haircut at points during the season \u2013 at one stage they only had three talls (of any position) available. John Longmire\u2019s side dragged games into the mud to keep them close, and they got a bit unlucky, losing five games by nine points or less. Flip a few of those, and combine it with a fit Buddy Franklin (and a fit everyone else), and their luck could change. On the last night of the trade period, Fox Footy\u2019s David King predicted a shock finals berth for the Swans \u2013 we reckon he might be right.\n\n5. Gold Coast will come agonisingly close to a first finals berth\n\nIt was only last year when the Suns were being handed extra draft picks and list spots because they were so damn bad. Almost everyone picked them to win the spoon in 2020. But the Suns avoided a bottom four finish, winning five games with a draw \u2013 and they were actually better than that. They faded in the back half of the season, most notably in the loss to Carlton where they were visibly exhausted in the first quarter, and losing explosive first-year gun Matt Rowell after four rounds didn\u2019t help. This group is very clearly going to be very good very soon, but 2021 might be just a tad too early. If you\u2019ll recall GWS\u2019 rise, they went from six wins and 16th on the ladder, to 11 wins and 11th, to 16 wins and fourth. That sounds about the right pace for Stuart Dew\u2019s men.\n\n6. Fremantle finally wins a flag, thanks to its AFLW side\n\nThe Dockers would\u2019ve been the most frustrated AFL Women\u2019s team last year, after going undefeated for the entire season and smashing Gold Coast in their first final before the season was called off due to the pandemic. Led by All-Australians Kiara Bowers and Gemma Houghton, expect the women in purple to be strong once again. Crucially they get fellow flag contenders North Melbourne at home in the west, while their final-round showdown with Carlton will also be a cracker.\n\n7. North Melbourne wins its first wooden spoon in 49 years\n\nThey\u2019ve won the second-most spoons in VFL/AFL history, sitting on 13 \u2013 well behind St Kilda\u2019s 27 \u2013 but North Melbourne actually has the third-longest drought since finishing last (1972), behind only Hawthorn (1965) and Geelong (1958). However we suspect if the 2020 season had gone a full 23 rounds, the Roos would\u2019ve ended their streak. Adelaide won three of their last four games and were clearly a better side by the end of the season. With an exodus of players and a first-time coach in David Noble, it should be a very rough year for the Shinboners. On the plus side North fans, the last time you won the spoon, you won a flag three years later.\n\n8. \u2026 But their top draft pick will finish second in the Rising Star count\n\nBarring any unforeseen circumstances, Will Phillips \u2013 the best pure midfielder in this year\u2019s draft \u2013 will slot straight into North\u2019s Round 1 centre bounce brigade. As a bottom-ager, Phillips was part of an Oakleigh Chargers midfield group that included Matt Rowell and Noah Anderson \u2013 and we all know the impact those two had at the Suns in their first years. Not only will Phillips play Round 1, he\u2019ll play almost every game in 2021. But former NAB League teammate Rowell will pinch the Rising Star award from him.\n\n9. Trent Rivers will be in All-Australian contention\n\nZak Butters was the surprise All-Australian squad bolter in his second year \u2014 and Rivers could be in the mix for a similar feat in his second AFL season. When Rivers regained his place in Melbourne\u2019s senior line-up late in 2020, he slotted in with aplomb, having between 14 and 16 disposals in each of his last six games. His composure across half-back will be well noticed, not only by Demons fans, but the All-Australian selection panel.\n\n10. Shai Bolton will poll more Brownlow votes than Dustin Martin\n\nWait, what? Didn\u2019t Dusty just claim his third Norm Smith in his third flag after a season where he polled more Brownlow Medal votes than any other Tiger? Yeah he did \u2014 but Bolton will be ready to take a giant step in 2021. He spent most of this year as a member of the Tigers\u2019 on-ball brigade, but expect him to up his output and have more influence on games next year. Bolton polled nine Brownlow votes in 2020 \u2014 the second-most at Richmond behind you-know-who. We reckon those placings could be flipped next year,\n\n11. Bailey Smith becomes the Bulldogs\u2019 best mid\n\nAll eyes next year will be on Adam Treloar and how his presence will affect the outputs of Marcus Bontempelli and Jackson Macrae. What Treloar\u2019s inclusion won\u2019t do is hinder Smith\u2019s development \u2014 in fact Smith might even get off the leash and become the Bulldogs\u2019 most dangerous on-baller. After finishing seventh in the Bulldogs\u2019 2020 best and fairest count, we\u2019re predicting Smith to take it out next year.\n\n12. Tom Hawkins and Jeremy Cameron will kick at least 110 goals between them\n\nAs individual players, Hawkins and Cameron are menacing prospects. In 2021, the pair will be in the same team and the same forward line \u2014 and they\u2019ll thrive. Hawkins is an awesome anchor forward that plays his best footy close to goal. Cameron now doesn\u2019t have to be \u2018the main man\u2019 inside 50 \u2014 like he so often was at the Giants \u2014 and can play as a genuine hybrid forward. Whether it\u2019s an even 60-60 split or one of them has a significantly higher percentage than the other, we\u2019re backing Cameron and Hawkins to combine for 110-plus goals.\n\n13. All three 2020 Swans draftees will play Round 1\n\nIt\u2019s not inconceivable all three of the Swans\u2019 2020 national draft recruits line up in the same Round 1 senior team. Logan McDonald has already proved he can match it with the big boys after a standout WAFL league season in 2020 that saw him kick 21 goals and finish fourth on the competition\u2019s goalkicking ladder. And despite their more diminutive stature, Academy selections Braeden Campbell and Errol Gulden have incredible footy nous and are ready to go. Considering the Swans already have a young best 22, there\u2019s every chance the aforementioned trio are all in the Round 1 mix.\n\n14. Essendon will slide into the bottom four\n\nThis might be in for a year of pain for the Bombers. The Bombers\u2019 2020 percentage of 79.2 \u2013 a result of big losses to finalists like the Bulldogs, Lions, Saints, Cats and Power \u2013 was the third-worst in the competition, yet they still finished 13th on the ladder. Now they\u2019ll be without one of their most important players in Adam Saad, while key goalkickers Orazio Fantasia and Joe Daniher are also at rival clubs. Yes they took three of the top players in this year\u2019s draft class earlier this month, while Peter Wright and Jye Caldwell both loom as promising additions in the long-term. But in the short-term, the Bombers won\u2019t improve on 2020 \u2014 in fact they\u2019ll dip, making Ben Rutten\u2019s first official season in charge a tough one.\n\nHe was one of the best stories of the 2020 draft \u2014 and he\u2019ll be one of the best stories of the 2021 season. Rowe, a gun small forward plucked from the Eagles in the SANFL, was the first mature-age state league player selected in this year\u2019s national draft after a 38-goal haul saw him share the 2020 Ken Farmer medal. The Crows, among many issues, really struggled to hit the scoreboard this year, but Rowe has the ability to walk in to the Crows\u2019 Round 1 line-up next year and assume a small forward role.\n\n16. Monique Conti to go from WNBL champion to AFLW best and fairest winner\n\nOn Sunday, Conti won her first WNBL championship with the Southside Flyers. By April, we\u2019re predicting the cross-code star to become the best player in the AFLW. Conti has already proven herself to be a star of the competition, being named best on ground in the Bulldogs\u2019 2018 grand final triumph, winning the Dogs\u2019 2019 best and fairest count and claiming Richmond\u2019s inaugural best and fairest award. Next year, Conti will become the competition\u2019s No. 1 player.\n\n17. Stephen Coniglio to bounce back \u2026 into the top three of the Brownlow\n\nThe 2020 season was particularly hard for Coniglio. The first-year captain was well down on his usually high output before sensationally losing his place in the side late in the year \u2014 all while his Giants slid out of the top eight for the first time in four years. But Coniglio is a star and will return to be among the competition\u2019s elite players in 2021. Not only that, he\u2019ll be on the Brownlow podium come season\u2019s end after having a career-best season.\n\n18. Brisbane only just makes the top eight\n\nAfter a preliminary final appearance in 2020, many believe Chris Fagan\u2019s Lions are perfectly placed to take an extra step in 2021. But we\u2019re predicting Brisbane could even slide a touch next year. The Lions had such an advantage this year with so many games based in Queensland, while they\u2019ve had two season with excellent injury runs. With Joe Daniher being such an unknown quantity, Brisbane might be due for a dip \u2014 albeit not a dramatic one.\n\n19. Collingwood plucks a big name in the trade period\n\nThis year was all about the players Collingwood lost post-season. Next year, it\u2019ll be about the star player the Pies will gain. The Pies have already flagged they\u2019ll be a big player in the 2021 free agency market after emptying some cap space. Top of Collingwood\u2019s list would no doubt be Carlton superstar Patrick Cripps and Western Bulldogs skipper Marcus Bontempelli. Maybe gun Essendon midfielder Zach Merrett, who attacked interest from Carlton, Port Adelaide and Hawthorn this year before stating he\u2019d see out the final year of his Bombers, could be the Magpies\u2019 most realistic target.\n\n20. Liam Ryan will be the Eagles\u2019 leading goalkicker\n\nJosh Kennedy and Jack Darling have dominated the top of West Coast\u2019s goalkicking table for years. But in 2021, it\u2019ll be Liam Ryan\u2019s time to shine. The 24-year-old, who made the All-Australian team in 2020, is capable of a big haul of goals, emphasised by his 2017 WAFL campaign that saw him win the Bernie Naylor medal with 76 goals. With the Eagles to be in premiership contention again, expect Ryan to be in Coleman Medal contention in his fourth AFL season and usurp Kennedy and Darling.\n\nWe said fearless predictions, not wrong ones.

Some will say he would, but not for me.\n\nGet all the latest football news, highlights and analysis delivered straight to your inbox with Fox Sports Sportmail. Sign up now!!!\n\n\u201cIf you are creating chances while still losing games, I would say of course you don\u2019t have to bring him in. But in games like Burnley at home, where you need someone to spot a pass for Aubameyang... Arteta tried to make a statement by not putting him in the squad, but he should take this on the chin and say it hasn\u2019t worked.\n\n\u201cThey should use him while they have got him. What\u2019s the point? Being in the position they are in without Ozil just doesn\u2019t make sense to me.\u201d\n\nFormer Liverpool and Scotland legend Graeme Souness though argued that Arteta cannot afford to bring Ozil back given he is already struggling to prove he is in control of this Arsenal team and can get them out of the current hole.\n\n\u201cI would imagine that Arteta will have spoken to the directors about the Ozil situation,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf you bring Ozil back now, he\u2019s coming back on his terms. Arteta made a big decision that he ran by the directors.\n\n\u201cAs long as he is sitting outside of the team, his value is going down and he\u2019s still being paid big money. They have a diminishing asset. They will be looking at that situation and questioning the decision.\n\n\u201cDo they bring him back? It takes some real man-management as Mikel is involved in his first job in management. This would be a difficult job for an experienced manager. He\u2019s got it all on to manage that situation and come out of it with his face. I\u2019m not so sure [if Ozil should come back into the fold].\n\n\u201cThe player coming back on his terms is never good. It diminishes his credibility and some of the players in that dressing room would use that against him.\u201d\n\nSouness did though take aim at Willian for one particular moment in the lead-up to the own goal which handed Everton an early lead.\n\nIn Sky Sports\u2019 half-time analysis, Souness pointed out a \u201cjogging\u201d Willian and questioned why he was not pushing harder to pressure Everton\u2019s Tom Davies.\n\nWhile Willian is not the only one guilty of this, Souness said it was evident of the lack of fight in this current Arsenal team.\n\n\u201cI want to highlight Willian here. You\u2019re looking to stop it,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt comes into Tom Davies, who ends up finding Alex Iwobi. Sprint back please, sprint back! You\u2019ve got a job to do defensively, Willian! Try and stop the cross, Willian, but he goes: \u201cOh, I\u2019ll just jog towards him!\u201d\u2019\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re defending, every player should be defending with their lives. This tells you that Arsenal are in trouble defensively and will continue to be in trouble defensively because the second goal highlights it again. It\u2019s so avoidable.

If not, their Week 17 clash with Pittsburgh could be a play-in game.\n\nMiami (8-5, games left: vs Patriots, at Raiders, at Bills) holds seventh spot for now over Baltimore (8-5, games left: vs Jaguars, vs Giants, at Bengals), but as you can see from those schedules, the Ravens are in a great position to overtake them for the last AFC berth.\n\nAll four of the Titans, Browns, Colts and Ravens are given a better-than 86 per cent chance of making the playoffs from here by FPI. The Dolphins will need to avoid a stumble to knock one of them out.\n\nLas Vegas (7-7) is relying on the Dolphins and Ravens both collapsing following their Thursday Night Football loss to the Chargers, with New England (6-7) in the same boat.\n\nIn the NFC, Green Bay (10-3, games left: vs Panthers, vs Titans, at Bears) was the major beneficiary of the Saints\u2019 shock loss to Philadelphia in Week 14.\n\nThe Packers have sealed the NFC North title and hold the head-to-head tiebreaker over New Orleans (10-3, games left: vs Chiefs, vs Vikings, at Panthers); so if the Saints lose to the Chiefs this week, the race for the top seed will be close to done.\n\nLos Angeles (9-4, games left: vs Jets, at Seahawks, vs Cardinals) has the edge over Seattle (9-4, games left: at Washington, vs Rams, at 49ers) for the NFC West title, with a showdown looming in Week 16, but both teams can lock up a playoff berth with a Week 15 win.\n\nSuddenly Washington (6-7, games left: vs Seahawks, vs Panthers, at Eagles) has the inside running for the NFC East title, winning four in a row and watching the Giants start to slide.\n\nNew York (5-8, games left: vs Browns, at Ravens, vs Cowboys) has the tiebreaker over their divisional rivals thanks to their two head-to-head wins, but is a game back with a tougher remaining schedule. Philadelphia (4-8-1, games left: at Cardinals, at Cowboys, vs Washington) has a chance but needs to keep winning.\n\nTampa Bay (8-5, games left: at Falcons, at Lions, vs Falcons) can still win the NFC South if they win out and the Saints go 0-3, but realistically they\u2019re near-certainties to secure a wildcard spot and their first playoff berth since 2007.\n\nThe final wildcard spot currently belongs to Arizona (7-6, games left: vs Eagles, vs 49ers, at Rams), who have a one-game edge over the Vikings and Bears and a kinder schedule.\n\nMinnesota (6-7, games left: vs Bears, at Saints, at Lions) and Chicago (6-7, games left: at Vikings, at Jaguars, vs Packers) play each other in Week 15, which will virtually eliminate the loser, and each have a game against an NFC title contender left as well.", "topic": "sports", "tag": "headline", "types": [], "claim": "", "verdict": ""}, {"url": "https://wwos.nine.com.au/football/marcus-thuram-apologises-for-spitting-in-opponents-face-bundesliga/85281ea9-4728-49d9-a681-e05f1d5b0407", "source": "wwos.nine.com.au", "authors": ["AP"], "title": "Footballer Marcus Thuram apologises for 'accidentally' spitting in rival's face - Wide World of Sports", "pubDate": "2020-12-20T10:07:30+00:00", "description": "Bundesliga forward Marcus Thuram has apologised for spitting in an opponent's face but also had a very sill...", "imageUrl": "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/adhNYhPPq2SqoGd8wG2X77aw35s=/0x0/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2Ffs%2F9949964d-27e7-4b66-8238-1476d5ef9254", "language": "en", "country": "au", "content": "Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach forward Marcus Thuram has apologised for spitting in an opponent's face during a game as he faces a lengthy ban.\n\nThuram was sent off after spitting at Hoffenheim defender Stefan Posch during a confrontation between the pair Saturday, with the score at 1-1.\n\nHoffenheim conceded another goal after Thuram, the son of France World Cup winner Lilian Thuram, was red-carded and went on to lose 2-1.\n\n\"Today something took place that is not in my character and must never happen.

It will not happen every week but it can happen,\u201d said the German.\n\n\u201cIt just clicked today. After a really intense period for the boys they should be really proud of how they came through that results-wise.\u201d\n\nVictory ensured Klopp\u2019s side will be top of the league at Christmas for a third successive season and, on this evidence, it is difficult to see how they are going to be stopped from winning a record-equalling 20th league title.\n\n\u201cWe will have a good Christmas,\u201d said Klopp.\n\n\u201cThe season is not finished, unfortunately.

Every manoeuvre costs fuel to fire rocket motors, and this fuel must currently be carried into space on the spacecraft.\n\nSpaceX's plan is for its crewed Starship vehicle to be refuelled in space by a separately launched fuel tanker. That means much more fuel can be carried into orbit than could be carried on a single launch.\n\nAnother challenge, intimately connected with fuel, is time.\n\nMissions that send spacecraft with no crew to the outer planets often travel complex trajectories around the Sun. They use what are called gravity assist manoeuvres to effectively slingshot around different planets to gain enough momentum to reach their target.\n\nThis saves a lot of fuel, but can result in missions that take years to reach their destinations. Clearly this is something humans would not want to do.\n\nBoth Earth and Mars have (almost) circular orbits and a manoeuvre known as the Hohmann transfer is the most fuel-efficient way to travel between two planets. Basically, without going into too much detail, this is where a spacecraft does a single burn into an elliptical transfer orbit from one planet to the other.\n\nA Hohmann transfer between Earth and Mars takes around 259 days (between eight and nine months) and is only possible approximately every two years due to the different orbits around the Sun of Earth and Mars.\n\nA spacecraft could reach Mars in a shorter time (SpaceX is claiming six months ) but \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 it would cost more fuel to do it that way.\n\nSuppose our spacecraft and crew get to Mars. The next challenge is landing.\n\nA spacecraft entering Earth is able to use the drag generated by interaction with the atmosphere to slow down. This allows the craft to land safely on the Earth's surface (provided it can survive the related heating).\n\nBut the atmosphere on Mars is about 100 times thinner than Earth's. That means less potential for drag, so it isn't possible to land safely without some kind of aid.\n\nSome missions have landed on airbags (such as NASA's Pathfider mission) while others have used thrusters (NASA's Phoenix mission). The latter, once again, requires more fuel.\n\nA Martian day lasts 24 hours and 37 minutes but the similarities with Earth stop there.\n\nThe thin atmosphere on Mars means it can't retain heat as well as Earth does, so life on Mars is characterised by large extremes in temperature during the day/night cycle.\n\nMars has a maximum temperature of 30\u2103, which sounds quite pleasant, but its minimum temperature is -140\u2103, and its average temperature is -63\u2103 . The average winter temperature at the Earth's South Pole is about -49\u2103 .\n\nSo we need to be very selective about where we choose to live on Mars and how we manage temperature during the night.\n\nThe gravity on Mars is 38% of Earth's (so you'd feel lighter) but the air is principally carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) with several percent of nitrogen, so it's completely unbreathable. We would need to build a climate-controlled place just to live there.\n\nSpaceX plans to launch several cargo flights including critical infrastructure such as greenhouses, solar panels and \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 a fuel-production facility for return missions to Earth.\n\nLife on Mars would be possible and several simulation trials have already been done on Earth to see how people would cope with such an existence.\n\nThe final challenge is the return journey and getting people safely back to Earth.\n\nApollo 11 entered Earth's atmosphere at about 40,000km/h, which is just below the velocity required to escape Earth's orbit.\n\nSpacecraft returning from Mars will have re-entry velocities from 47,000km/h to 54,000km/h, depending on the orbit they use to arrive at Earth.\n\nRead more: Dear diary: the Sun never set on the Arctic Mars simulation\n\nThey could slow down into low orbit around Earth to around 28,800km/h before entering our atmosphere but \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 they'd need extra fuel to do that.\n\nIf they just barrel into the atmosphere, it will do all of the deceleration for them.

What can we plant? The questions triggered heated discussions online over the weekend after Chang'e 5 returned to Earth on Thursday with 1,731 grams of samples from the moon.But science might have disappointed them. \"Unlike the organic soil on earth, the soil from the moon does not contain any organic nutrients and is very dry, which is neither suitable for growing vegetables nor potatoes,\" Zhu Guangquan, a CCTV anchor, said via a video posted on the Sina Weibo account of CCTV on Saturday, quoting scientists.Chinese netizens have been highly interested in growing vegetables on the moon. The topic \"Lunar soil really can't grow vegetables\" gains more than 63.3 million views on Sina Weibo and was discussed more than 17,000 times as of press time.There were more than 8,100 comments below the video. \"Chinese people really hold on to the idea of growing vegetables throughout history,\" a Sina Weibo user @Siberian-shuaihe joked.Another Weibo user commented, \"Yuan Longping's eyes have lit up: there is no place where rice cannot grow!\" Yuan, a globally renowned agronomist known for developing the first hybrid rice strains, is dubbed as \"father of hybrid rice\".However, although the soil on the moon cannot grow vegetables, it can be used in other ways. The long-term solar wind injected a large amount of helium-3 into the lunar soil, which can be used as clean energy and generating electricity through thermonuclear fusion, according to the video posted by CCTV.China National Space Administration (CNSA) held a lunar sample handover ceremony on Saturday morning in Beijing, where the sample was handover to Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).The lunar samples will be divided into three parts for different purposes, CNSA deputy head Wu Yanhua said. Labs for scientific research will receive some, while the other two will be displayed in national museums for the public's education and shared with the international community in accordance with lunar data management regulations. They could even be given as special gifts to countries that work closely with China on aerospace matters.A Weibo user also assumed boldly, \"If we cannot grow vegetables on the moon, how about going to Mars and get some soil sample from there for study?\"China launched the country's first-ever Mars probe, codenamed Tianwen-1, on July 23 and currently, it has traveled 370 million kilometers and reached more than 100 million kilometers from Earth, according to CNSA's update last week.Soldiers of the Chinese navy have successfully grown vegetables in sand in Yongxing Island in the Xisha Islands of the South China Sea.

But I would also expand that to lots of other people as well.\u201d\n\nPolice officers, those in essential industries such as grocery stores, factories and food processing or anyone vital to the economy working in close indoor settings and in close proximity to other people should also be considered for the vaccine, said Bogoch.\n\n\u201cSo while I certainly agree with teachers, I\u2019d expand that to other essential workers who might be at greater risk of getting this infection.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a position shared by others, including the Ontario Medical Association (OMA). According to the group of Ontario doctors, those at highest risk of contracting COVID-19 should be the top priority for the vaccine, but added that other groups to be vaccinated in subsequent phases include essential workers, as well as teachers and those in communal facilities like shelters and prisons.\n\nAccording to the results of an Ipsos poll conducted last month, front-line workers, first responders, seniors and long-term care home staff ranked as the highest in who should get vaccinated first. Schoolteachers and essential workers garnered 20 per cent and 24 per cent, respectively, of agreement that they should be among the first in line to get their shot.\n\nIn their statement, however, the CTF argued that education workers would be easily exposed to the disease as students under the age of 16 have not been approved to take the vaccine.\n\nBogoch said that while that point was valid, it wouldn\u2019t make sense to vaccinate kids now since only high-priority groups were receiving vaccines for the time being.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still in phase one. So it\u2019s going to take some time for these vaccine programs to readily expand,\u201d said Bogoch.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t disagree with teachers. Don\u2019t get me wrong. I think that\u2019s very reasonable. But I also think that those conversations should include others that fall into that category, like other essential workers who are at greater risk of getting or amplifying, unfortunately, this infection based on where they work.\u201d", "topic": "health", "tag": "headline", "types": [], "claim": "", "verdict": ""}, {"url": "https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/race-to-vaccinate-faster-than-new-strain-of-coronavirus-infects-v3jdn7wk6", "source": "thetimes.co.uk", "authors": ["Tom Whipple, Science Editor"], "title": "Race to vaccinate faster than new strain of coronavirus infects - The Times", "pubDate": "2020-12-20T18:00:00+00:00", "description": "It is now injections, or infections.
